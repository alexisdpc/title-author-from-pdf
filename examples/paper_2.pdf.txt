Two events define the beginning of the modern era of membrane-protein 
biophysics: the determination of the three-dimensional structure of 
bacteriorhodopsin1 at low resolution by Richard Henderson and Nigel 
Unwin in 1975, and the atomic-resolution structure of the Rhodopseudo-
monas viridis photosynthetic reaction centre2 by Johann Deisenhofer and 
Hartmut Michel in 1985. Although spectroscopic studies3,4 of isolated 
membranes had suggested in the mid-1960s that the proteins of plasma 
membranes are largely α-helical, Henderson and Unwin’s 1975 structure1 
established unequivocally the existence of transmembrane α-helices in 
a membrane protein. Deisenhofer and Michel’s structure confirmed the 
presence of transmembrane α-helices and allowed an atomic-level inter-
pretation of biophysical data for the first time. As important as the struc-
ture was on its own, the more important accomplishment may simply 
have been to demonstrate that membrane proteins could be crystallized, 
thereby opening the way for atomic-resolution X-ray crystallography.
As other groups picked up the challenge, progress accelerated (Fig. 1a) 
such that now, 24 years later, we have high-resolution structures for 
more than 180 unique proteins (Fig. 1b). What have we learned about 
membrane-protein biophysics as a result? In this Overview, I extract 
some general features of membrane-protein biophysics from the five 
reviews that follow in this Insight, which dissect the operation of several 
membrane proteins at the atomic level. The clearest feature is that inter-
actions with the lipid bilayer are important, but no general principles 
about these have yet emerged. Symmetry, which arises from gene dupli-
cations, is seen to be a building block of transporter function. In addi-
tion, we find that water can penetrate deeply into membrane proteins, 
despite the non-polar character of the bilayer. As expected from their 
biosynthetic pathways, all plasma-membrane proteins are α-helical 
bundles, but there are wide variations in geometry, related in part to 
water penetration and interactions with the bilayer. Seven-helix bundles, 
which are hallmarks of G-protein-coupled receptors, seem ideally mini-
malist and are extremely versatile signalling platforms.
Transporter structural motifs
Sodium-coupled transporters, which are reviewed by Eric Gouaux 
(see page 347), are an important class of membrane protein, exhibiting 
pseudo-two-fold symmetry and deep water penetration. These so-called 
secondary transporters are ‘couplers’ because they couple the energetic 
‘uphill’ movement of one solute to the ‘downhill’ movement of another 
solute. For sodium-coupled transporters, the energy gained from the 
movement of sodium ions down an electrochemical gradient is used to 
concentrate substrates, such as aspartate5 and leucine6, on one side of the 
membrane. These transporters, which take advantage of the two-fold 
structural symmetry, work as ‘rocker switches’ to provide alternating 
access to the two sides of the membrane7. As Gouaux points out, a broad 
range of transporters share these features despite having low sequence 
identity and differing numbers of transmembrane helices. For example, 
the vSGLT sodium/galactose symporter8 has 14 transmembrane helices 
and the Mhp1 benzyl-hydantoin transporter9 has 12 transmembrane 
helices, but the transporter function is carried out by pseudo-two-fold-
related 5+5 transmembrane repeats.
Signalling and seven-helix bundles
Another class of couplers are the G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 
These seven-helix membrane proteins receive an optical or chemical 
signal on the extracellular membrane surface and initiate G-protein-
based signalling cascades in the cytoplasm. GPCRs, which are cate-
gorized into six subclasses, form the largest single class of eukaryotic 
membrane proteins and are the targets of many of the drugs being devel-
oped by pharmaceutical companies10. Because of their pharmaceutical 
importance, there have been extensive efforts — dating back to 1992 at 
least11 — to build molecular models of ligand-activated GPCRs to guide 
drug discovery. The first models were based on bacteriorhodopsin, 
which has seven transmembrane helices and a covalently linked retinal 
whose photoexcitation drives proton transport. But when the struc-
ture of bovine rhodopsin, a true GPCR, was determined12, modellers 
turned their attentions to that, with little success13. Finally, in 2007, the 
first structures of ligand-activated GPCRs became available, starting 
with human β2 adrenergic receptor co-crystallized with Fab5 antibod-
ies14. On page 356, Daniel Rosenbaum, Søren Rasmussen and Brian 
Kobilka review the structural and mechanistic insights into GPCR 
function gained from these structures, which include higher-resolution 
structures of β2 adrenergic receptor15,16, turkey β1 adrenergic receptor17, 
human A2A adenosine receptor18, opsin19 and squid rhodopsin20. 
A recent mini-review provides a close structural comparison of 
GPCR structures21. The lesson that emerges is that the seven-transmem-
brane-helix bundle is extremely adaptable, and perhaps also minimalist. 
Why minimalist? Bacteriorhodopsin can be refolded in lipid vesicles 
from separated helices (A, B and CDEFG)22. Using retinal absorbance 
as a measure of folding, neither A+CDEFG nor B+CDEFG gives native 
spectra, whereas A+B+CDEFG does. This implies that seven is the 
minimum number of helices needed to maintain the native environ-
ment of retinal. It may be that seven helices provide ample space for 
a wide range of ligands through relatively minor helix distortions and 
reorientations, without the need to increase or decrease the number of 
transmembrane helices.
Biophysical dissection of 
membrane proteins
Stephen H. White1
The first atomic-resolution structure of a membrane protein was solved in 1985. Twenty-four years and more 
than 180 unique structures later, what have we have learned? An examination of the atomic details of several 
diverse membrane proteins reveals some remarkable biophysical features and suggests that we can expect to 
achieve much more in the decades to come.

Helix hairpins
A physicist friend once opined that the concept sketches, such as rocker 
switches, drawn by biologists must be hopelessly naive. Surely the real 
mechanisms must be far more subtle, drawing on sophisticated physics 
not yet revealed? Well, membrane protein machines really do function 
largely according to the principles embodied in the sketches (which, of 
course, summarize years of painstaking work, a fact overlooked by my 
friend). This is certainly true of FOF1 ATPase (or simply ATP synthase). 
Paul Boyer introduced in the 1980s the concept of rotary catalysis23 by 
F1 ATPase; John Walker and colleagues24 provided the nearly complete 
structural details of rotary catalysis by solving the structure of the ATP 
synthase at atomic resolution.
ATP synthase generates ATP from proton electrochemical gradients in 
mitochondria. The ATP-producing F1 domain is a rotor with a shaft that 
passes through the membrane-embedded FO sector, which is composed 
of ten transmembrane two-helix c-subunits. The multiple two-helix-
hairpin motif is apparently ideal for flexibly stabilizing large complexes 
with circular symmetry, such as light-harvesting complexes25,26. ATP 
synthases of different types can have up to 14 c-subunit hairpins27. 
Although the exact biochemical reason for variations in c-subunit 
number is not understood, structurally it seems to be an efficient way 
to expand a boundary of a membrane protein. Need a larger boundary? 
Just add a few more hairpins. Protons that pass through FO on their way 
down the electrochemical gradient drive the F1 rotor to produce ATP 
via the mechanical energy produced. Remarkably, the rotation of the 
rotor can be observed and quantified by attaching a fluorescent actin 
filament to the γ-subunit shaft28. Wolfgang Junge and his colleagues 
Hendrik Sielaff and Siegfried Engelbrecht describe the structure and 
operation of this remarkable machine in their review (see page 364). 
Junge provides excellent movies of the synthase in action as Supplemen-
tary Information. More movies and structural information can be found 
at www.biologie.uni-osnabrueck.de/biophysik/junge/picsmovs.html 
and www.mrc-dunn.cam.ac.uk/research/atp_synthase.
Bilayer distortion
Intramembrane-cleaving proteases (iCLIPs), first identified by Michael 
Brown, Joseph Goldstein and colleagues29,30, irreversibly cleave trans-
membrane helices to release tethered signalling domains intra- or extra-
cellularly. For example, site-2 protease (S2P) cleaves the cytoplasmic 
domain of the mammalian sterol regulatory element-binding protein 
(SREBP). The liberated domain then travels to the nucleus to activate 
genes involved in cholesterol and fatty-acid biosynthesis. An iCLIP of 
current interest is the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, presenilin, which 
liberates the amyloid-β peptide. S2P and presenilin are examples of 
metallo- and aspartyl proteases, respectively. A third class of iCLIP 
comprises the rhomboid serine proteases, which in Drosophila liberate 
the epidermal growth factor domain by cleaving the single-transmem-
brane Spitz protein. 
The conceptual difficulty with iCLIPs is that they must carry out 
hydrolytic reactions within the hydrophobic membrane interior. The 
mystery of how they achieve this is emerging from the recently pub-
lished structures of S2P31 and rhomboid proteases from the bacteria 
Escherichia coli32–34 and Haemophilus influenzae35, as discussed by Elinor 
Erez, Deborah Fass and Eitan Bibi in their comprehensive but succinct 
review of intramembrane proteases (see page 371). As with sodium-
coupled transporters, there is deep penetration of water into the heart 
of the rhomboid, allowing peptide-bond hydrolysis by a catalytic dyad 
composed of serine and histidine. An unusual (perhaps even unique) 
feature of the six-helix rhomboids is the rather large L1 helical loop 
between helix 1 and helix 2 that protrudes parallel to the membrane 
plane with deep penetration into the bilayer interface. The exact func-
tion of this loop is uncertain, but it may be involved in the regulation 
of proteolysis. Helix 5 sits at the membrane entrance to the catalytic 
site, but is on the opposite side of the protein to L1. Molecular dynamic 
simulations36 suggest that there is dynamic coupling between L1 and 
helix 5, consistent with a regulatory role for L1. The simulations also 
show that the irregular shape of the protein causes significant bilayer 
deformation in the vicinity of the active site, and that hydrogen-bond 
interactions with bilayer lipids affect protein orientation and dynamics. 
Distortion of the lipids in the vicinity of the active site may be necessary 
to admit both water and transmembrane-helix substrates.
Restoring the bilayer to membrane proteins
The function of rhomboid proteases requires careful consideration of 
the effect of the lipid membrane itself, within which all membrane pro-
teins must exist and function. The difficulty with membrane-protein 
crystallographic structures is that we never see the surrounding mem-
brane, except to the extent that a few lipids or solubilizing detergent 
molecules may form part of a crystal’s unit cell. A powerful approach 
to understanding a membrane protein in context is to restore the 
membrane and its lipids computationally, which can be done either 
by atomic-level molecular dynamics simulations37 or by continuum 
mechanics. Rob Phillips, Tristan Ursell, Paul Wiggins and Pierre Sens 
describe the use of the latter approach (see page 379), which is espe-
cially useful for understanding the interplay between tension-gated 
ion channels and the membrane. It is also useful for describing the

interactions between proteins in the crowded membrane environment38. 
A fundamental question for the future is how to move seamlessly 
between continuum and atomic-level simulations.
Structural themes
Some unexpected structural themes have emerged from the X-ray 
structures of membrane proteins discussed here. The bacteriorhodopsin 
structure, finally solved to atomic resolution by electron crystallo-
graphy39 in 1996 and by X-rays40 in 1997, revealed the transmembrane-
helix bundle as the fundamental structural motif of plasma-membrane 
proteins (bacterial, mitochondrial and chloroplast outer-membrane 
proteins generally have a β-barrel motif 41,42). The seven-helix bundle 
characteristic of bacteriorhodopsin is a remarkably versatile motif, as is 
apparent from G-protein-coupled receptors. Proteins involved in proton 
and electron transport form very tight ‘waterproof’ bundles, whereas 
transporters such as the E. coli lactose permease43 and the mitochon-
drial ADP/ATP carrier44 have large, water-filled cavities that extend 
almost completely across the membrane. Sodium-coupled transporters 
share this feature, albeit to a lesser extent. Also discovered in the first 
structure of an ion channel, the KcsA potassium channel45, these water-
filled cavities complicate the prediction of membrane-protein topology 
by hydropathy analysis.
Another theme to emerge is an internal structural repeat and inversion 
of the first half of the protein to form a helix bundle with a pseudo-two-
fold symmetry about an axis parallel to the membrane plane. This pat-
tern apparently arises from ancient gene duplications, as described in 
detail in a recent review46. In a few cases, such as the E. coli EmrE multi-
drug transporter47, the two-fold symmetry may arise from two dual-
topology monomers inserted with opposite topologies48 to form the 
functional homodimer. Finally, from studies of voltage-sensor domains49 
that control voltage-dependent ion channels and enzymes, and which 
can act as ion channels themselves, we now know that charged amino 
acids, especially arginine, can be buried directly in the lipid bilayer as a 
result of salt bridges and lipid polar-group interactions.
The biophysical motifs discussed here are highlights from a rich menu 
of structures. The 180 unique structures available at the end of 2008 have 
revolutionized our understanding of membrane proteins. What does the 
future hold? What new motifs and folds will appear? James Bowie and 
colleagues50 have estimated that about 1,700 membrane-protein struc-
tures are needed to account for each structural family. At the present 
pace and level of technology, that will take about 30 years. So stay tuned 
for the remarkable progress of the past 24 years to continue.

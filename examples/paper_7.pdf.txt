CONSTRAINT ON SEESAW MODEL PARAMETERS WITH 
ELECTROWEAK VACUUM STABILITY 
H. Okane and T. Morozumi 
 UDC 530.22, 530.225 
Within the standard model, the electroweak vacuum is metastable. We study how heavy right-handed neutrinos 
in seesaw model have impact on the stability through their loop effect for the Higgs potential. Requiring the 
lifetime of the electroweak vacuum is longer than the age of the Universe, the constraint on parameters such as 
their masses and the strength of the Yukawa couplings is obtained.  
Keywords: vacuum stability, lifetime of vacuum, neutrino physics. 
INTRODUCTION 
So far, there have been many studies on whether an electroweak (EW) vacuum is stable or not. Due to precise 
measurements of the Higgs and top masses, within the Standard Model (SM), the EW vacuum is shown to be 
metastable [1, 2]. This means that although the EW vacuum is unstable and may decay to the true vacuum, the lifetime 
of the EW vacuum is longer than the age of the Universe. If the EW vacuum in the model is unstable, such as in the 
SM, the calculation of the lifetime is important to analyze whether the model can guarantee the stability of the EW 
vacuum or not. 
Coleman and Callan [3, 4] first derived the decay rate for unstable vacuum in quantum theory. Isidori et al. [5] 
estimated the lifetime of the EW vacuum up to the one-loop level within the SM, and they constrained on the Higgs 
mass by requiring that the lifetime be longer than the age of the Universe. Actually, the Higgs mass discovered in 2012 
indicates that the EW vacuum is metastable rather than absolutely stable [1, 2]. The ultimate goal of our study is to 
estimate the lifetime of the EW vacuum for a new model beyond the SM and constrain on the new parameters by the 
requirement for the EW vacuum to be stable. 
To discuss the lifetime of the EW vacuum, following [5, 6], we write the lifetime   as

We study the stability of the EW vacuum in the seesaw model which can explain the measurements of neutrino

MR
 is the majorana neutrino mass. 
Through the neutrino-Higgs Yukawa interaction, neutrino can contribute to the running of Higgs self-coupling  , 
which determines the lifetime of the EW vacuum at tree-level, and to the one-loop correction of action 
S
 in Eq. (1). 
We would like to consider three-generation neutrinos in the seesaw model, but the derivation for the loop correction of 
one-generation neutrino is not yet complete. So we will show interim results for the loop correction of one-generation 
neutrino.  
LOOP CORRECTIONS TO THE LIFETIME OF THE ELECTROWEAK VACUUM IN THE SEE SAW 
MODEL  
In this section, we derive loop corrections of Higgs and top to the lifetime of the EW vacuum and show interim 
results for the loop correction of one-generation neutrino. We can write the loop corrections of Higgs, top, and neutrino

level is divergent, we need to implement the renormalization for loop contribution to be finite. The finite loop

SUMMARY 
We have shown the computations of the Higgs and top loop correction to the lifetime of the EW vacuum and 
interim results of the neutrino loop correction. In order to survey the vacuum stability of the seesaw model, we need to 
estimate loop corrections of neutrino and gauge bosons. The complete calculation of loop correction is important to 
reduce the uncertainty of renormalization scale dependence [7]. We will continue to calculate the loop correction of 
neutrino, and this calculation will help the analysis of the vacuum stability in the seesaw model.  
The lifetime of the EW vacuum in the seesaw model with three degenerate neutrinos and constrain on the 
neutrino-Higgs Yukawa coupling and right handed neutrino mass was computed in [8]. We plan to generalize this 
analysis to the case of non-degenerate neutrinos and to use the measurements of neutrino oscillations as inputs 
computing the lifetime of the EW vacuum. It is interesting to study how the measurements of neutrino oscillation reflect 
the EW vacuum stability.

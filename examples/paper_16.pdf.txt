In the coming renewables-based energy transition, global electricity consumption is expected to double by 2050, 
entailing widespread end-use electrification, with significant impacts on energy efficiency. We develop a long- 
run, worldwide societal exergy analysis focused on electricity. Our 1900–2017 electricity world database con-
tains the energy carriers used in electricity production, final end-uses, and efficiencies. We find world primary-to- 
final exergy (i.e. conversion) efficiency increased rapidly from 1900 (6%) to 1980 (39%), slowing to 43% in 2017 
as power station generation technology matured. Next, despite technological evolution, final-to-useful end-use 
efficiency was surprisingly constant (~48%), due to “efficiency dilution”, wherein individual end-use efficiency 
gains are offset by increasing uptake of less efficient end uses. Future electricity efficiency therefore depends on 
the shares of high efficiency (e.g. electrified transport) and low efficiency (e.g. cooling and low temperature 
heating) end uses. Our results reveal past conversion efficiency increases (carbon intensity of electricity pro-
duction reduced from 5.23 kgCO2/kWh in 1900 to 0.49 kgCO2/kWh in 2017) did little to decrease global 
electricity-based CO2 emissions, which rose 380-fold. The historical slow-pace of transition in generation mix and 
the need to electrify end-uses suggest that strong incentives are needed to meet climate goals.   
1. Introduction 
1.1. Global electricity demand is projected to have rapid growth 
The share of electricity in world total final consumption (TFC) has 
increased significantly, from 0.1% (1900) to 4% by mid-century (1950), 
and 19% in 2022 [1,2]. Importantly, global electricity demand keeps 
rising, and is projected by the International Renewable Energy Agency 
(IRENA) to double between 2015 and 2050 [3]. While electricity gen-
eration doubled between 1990 and 2014 [4], carbon dioxide (CO2) 
emissions associated with electricity increased only slightly less, 87%, 
from 6.28 GtCO2 to 11.76 GtCO2 [5]. To limit end-of-century warming 
to 1.5 ◦C [6] whilst meeting UN Sustainable Development Goal #7 
(affordable and clean energy) [7], electrification, renewables, and en-
ergy efficiency are thought to be essential [3]. Electrification and 
renewables will mean rapid growth in electricity generation and con-
sumption into the future, but energy efficiency is a complex and nuanced 
issue, with impacts on economic growth, energy rebound, and aggregate 
efficiency [8–10]. 
Electrification of end uses will enable widespread deployment of 
low-carbon, electricity-producing sources of energy, especially wind and 
solar. IRENA forecasts that, by 2050, 33% of final energy for transport 
will be provided by electricity, up from 1% in 2015 [3]. Buildings are 
also expected to increase their electricity demand by 70% until 2050, 
from their 2015 value, due to increased cooling demand, electrification 
of heating, and growing electricity consumption in developing countries 
[3,11]. Other forecasts propose scenarios which rely on near 100% 
electrification with renewables to reach climate targets, where demand 
for electricity is expected to more than double [12–14]. 
Beyond electrification, emerging end uses will add to future

electricity demand, especially information and communication tech-
nology (ICT). For three specific categories of ICT (communication net-
works, personal computers, and data centres), Heddeghem et al. [15] 
found that between 2007 and 2012 electricity consumption from ICT 
uses grew at 7% per year, while overall electricity use increased only 3% 
per year, thereby raising the share of total worldwide electricity con-
sumption for ICT to 4.6%. The increase in electricity demand due to 
electrification and emerging energy uses will be partially controlled by 
energy efficiency. 
1.2. The uncertainty of the impact of energy efficiency on electricity 
demand 
Energy efficiency can be calculated between different stages of the 
energy conversion chain. Societies use primary energy such as coal in a 
thermoelectric power plant or wind energy in a wind farm to produce 
final energy in the form of electricity. Afterwards, electricity is trans-
formed to useful energy such as light in lamps or heat in electric heaters 
or heat pumps. 
The estimation of useful energy is crucial because it is closer to the 
energy services that people and firms want and therefore more closely 
tied to economic activity than final energy. As such, it is the appropriate 
stage at which to measure energy when the goal is understanding trends 
in the relationship between energy and economic activity, which is an 
essential step to make scenarios of the future energy transition. One can 
estimate the energy efficiency of each conversion, that is the ratio of 
“useful” energy output to “final” energy input. The higher the energy 
efficiency, the better. However, energy efficiency gives us incomplete 
information about potential energy savings. For example, the energy 
efficiency of an electric heater is 100% which suggests that there are no 
potential energy savings. However, this is not the case because a heat 
pump can provide the same output using ¼ of the electricity. Here, we 
address this issue using exergy efficiency which is also the ratio of useful 
output to input but using exergy to quantify energy. Exergy is a mea-
surement of energy that quantifies the potential of an energy flow to do 
physical work [16]. For electricity and mechanical work, exergy is equal 
to the energy content because these types of energy can be completely 
converted into work. For heat, exergy content is lower than its energy 
because even an ideal Carnot machine cannot completely convert heat at 
a temperature TH into work: it needs to reject some heat at a lower 
temperature TC. The fundamental constraint in the conversion of heat 
into work is associated with the fact that heat carries both energy and 
entropy. Since entropy cannot be destroyed, the Carnot machine needs 
to reject heat to get rid of the entropy. 
The use of exergy is important not only to estimate an efficiency that 
provides a meaningful measure of the potential energy savings because 
the maximum exergy efficiency is 100% but also because exergy effi-
ciency and useful exergy have been empirically linked to economic 
growth [8]. Economies run on work that (as opposed to heat) shapes 
materials, assembles machines and products, and transports people, 
goods, and services throughout the economy. To a lesser extent, econ-
omies also consume heat. But heat can (and probably should) be sup-
plied via a heat pump, which consumes work (usually in the form of 
electricity). Useful exergy is the amount of work (or electricity) needed 
as input to the economy when all potential energy savings have been 
accomplished. 
Three recent studies illustrate the complexities of energy efficiency. 
First, Serrenho et al. [17,18] showed that the ratio of useful exergy to 
GDP for Portugal is approximately constant, a finding that holds for the 
other EU-15 countries if the relative size of heavy industry end uses 
(High temperature heat (HTH)) and domestic end uses (Low Tempera-
ture Heat (LTH)) remain constant. Second, Santos et al. [9] show that an 
increase in final-to-useful exergy efficiency makes a key contribution to 
higher GDP for Portugal. Third, Ferguson et al. [19] shows electricity 
consumption and economic development are strongly correlated for 
more than 100 countries between 1971 and 1995. Taken together, these 
three relationships imply increases in final-to-useful efficiency 
contribute to economic growth and, paradoxically, an increase in the 
demand of energy, a phenomenon known as energy rebound. Indeed, 
Ayres et al. [20] state efficiency gains at the final-to-useful stage lead to 
higher final energy consumption. However, overall effects of 
final-to-useful efficiency increases on the demand for final energy can be 
positive or negative, depending on the presence of rebound effects [21]. 
Furthermore, the relationship between electricity efficiency and 
aggregate final-to-useful efficiency is complex [22]. In Portugal between 
1900 and 2009, the aggregated final-to-useful efficiency was always 
lower than 25% [17], while final-to-useful efficiency for electricity was 
always above 30% [23]. Also, in Mexico between 1971 and 2009, 
electricity is the energy carrier with the highest final-to-useful efficiency 
[24]. The same occurred in the US where Ayres et al. [22] estimated a 
high stable, average value of 55%, for the final-to-useful US electricity 
efficiency between 1900 and 2000. Thus, the growing use of electricity 
increases aggregate final-to-useful exergy efficiency [25]. 
Regarding, primary-to-useful efficiency, Brockway et al. [26] anal-
yse the UK and USA, for the period 1960–2010. While rising UK elec-
tricity exergy efficiency drove increases to UK aggregate exergy 
efficiency, USA aggregate exergy efficiency remained very stable due to 
efficiency dilution caused by increasing consumption of low-efficiency 
air conditioning [26]. In Portugal, the primary-to-useful efficiency of 
electricity increased between 1900 and 1990 but stagnated afterwards 
[23] due to increasing share of electricity consumed in less-efficient 
sectors, mainly residential and commercial. 
This emerging picture of the role of useful exergy and efficiency on 
economic growth and energy consumption (and CO2 emissions) is illu-
minating. However, current understanding is based on analyses of single 
countries [17,22–25,27,28] or a small number of countries (between 2 
and 15 countries) [18,26] over short timescales (40–50 years) [18,24, 
26,28] with little-to-no electricity end-use detail [25,27]. A few studies 
[17,22,23] have longer timescales with more detail on electricity con-
sumption but focus on single countries (Portugal and US). Additionally, 
these studies use varying methodologies to estimate efficiencies, leading 
to results inhibiting comparison [29]. At the world level, there are two 
studies for a single year [30,31] and only one long-run (1900–2010) 
study [1], which calculated final-to-useful efficiencies using GDP as 
proxy, thereby linking energy and economic growth. Additionally, the 
long-run study [1] lacks detail in allocations of electricity to end-uses, 
assuming constant end-use shares within each sector throughout the 
period 1900–2010. These assumptions are problematic, because the 
estimation of overall electricity efficiency is highly dependent on both 
(a) the detail in allocating electricity to end uses (see Refs. [23,32]) and 
(b) the methods used to estimate efficiencies [29]. 
1.3. Motivation, aim, contribution, and structure 
The motivation for this paper is based on the increasing importance of 
electricity in the future, due to both (a) the need to decarbonise energy 
systems and (b) increasing share of end-uses such as ICT. Individual 
country studies have shown that the efficiency of electricity production 
and consumption has significant impacts on final-to-useful and primary- 
to-final efficiencies, economic growth, and greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions. However, our historical knowledge is incomplete, because 
there is no detailed, world-level exergy-based study covering a long time 
span that focuses on electricity end-uses. A long-run analysis of past 
electricity production, efficiency trends, and carbon emissions will 
provide insights to guide scenarios and policies for electrification, re-
newables, and energy efficiency. 
The aim of this article is to evaluate world long-term trends of past 
electricity consumption and production, end-uses, efficiency, and car-
bon intensity. The key contributions of this paper are the development of 
(a) a detailed world long-run database for electricity production and 
consumption and (b) historical time series datasets for the evolution of 
primary-to-final, 
final-to-useful, 
and 
primary-to-useful 
exergy

The structure of this paper is as follows: In section 2, we explain the 
method for constructing a world database for electricity consumption 
and production. In section 3, we show results for world electricity pro-
duction and consumption, efficiencies, and carbon emissions. In section 
4, we discuss the results in historical perspective and in the context of 
the ongoing decarbonization transition. Section 5 summarizes. 
2. Data and methods 
Electricity production data provides the starting point, because it is 
the energy stage available in yearbooks and books, for construction of 
the long run database of primary, final, and useful electricity. Electricity 
production is the electricity that leaves the alternator in a power plant, 
so it is considered final energy. Fig. 1 and table A9 of the supplementary 
information A summarize the steps used to calculate primary and useful 
exergy as well the main sources used to obtain the data necessary to 
these calculations. The following subsections will go into further details 
about each stage of the energy conversion chain: primary, final, and 
useful. 
2.1. Final energy stage: electricity production and sources 
Our starting point was Etemad et al. “World Energy Production” 
[33]. Two years were assessed first: 1920 and 1970 Fig. 2. The year 1920 
is the first year for which most countries have data available on elec-
tricity production in Etemad et al. [33]. The year 1970 is the year before 
world data are available from the International Energy Agency (IEA). 
Countries were divided in three groups: large, medium, and small pro-
ducers, as shown in Fig. 3. Large producers (Canada, Germany, Japan, 
UK, USA, and USSR) supplied more than 5% of the world electricity in 
1920 or 1970. Fig. 4 shows the share of the world total electricity of 
these countries for the period 1900–1970 (Canada [36], Germany 
[37–39], Japan [40], UK [41,42], USA [43] and USSR [44–46]).1 When 
no other source of data was available, Etemad et al. [33] was used. For 
years in which no data were available, we interpolated linearly. 
Medium producers are all countries that produced more than 1% of 
the world electricity in 1920 or 1970: Australia, Austria, China, Cze-
choslovakia, France, India, Italy, Norway, Poland, South Africa, Spain, 
Sweden, and Switzerland. Fig. 4 shows the share of world electricity 
production by these countries for the period 1900–1970. The classifi-
cation of a country as a big, medium or small producer controlled the 
amount of effort in gathering data for that country between 1900 and 
1970. More data were collected for large and medium countries. Fig. 4 
shows that the maximum amount of electricity produced by all small 
producers between 1900 and 1970 is 10%. 
Data for thermal and hydroelectricity production for France, Italy, 
and Spain were found in the statistical yearbooks of each country and for 
Italy also in Malanima [47–50]. The primary reference for Spain, the 
statistical yearbook [48] includes only total production values, so hy-
droelectricity production until 1928 was estimated based on Rodríguez 
[51]. Missing values for hydroelectricity production in France prior to 
1925 [47] were estimated based on Bordes [52]. For France, we deter-
mined the share of oil in thermal electricity for 1952 [53] and natural 
gas share for 1957 and 1958 [47]. Together with data for 1960 from the 
IEA [34], we interpolated other years. In the case of Italy, for 
1925–1960, we identified the share of each fuel in thermal electricity 
generation based on Castelli [54]. 
Norway and Sweden data series started with high values of 
hydroelectricity, indicating that production started before Etemad et al. 
series [33], so we looked for other data to complete the series until 1900. 
For Norway 1900–1936, we estimated hydroelectricity production using 
a report for all hydropower plants in use in 1943 [55]. (See supple-
mentary information (SI) A.) For Norway 1930–1960, we estimated 
thermal electricity sources using statistical yearbooks [56]. For Sweden 
1900–1928, we estimated hydroelectricity production using shares of 
hydro generation available in Kander et al. [57]. South Africa electricity 
production data was taken from the Bureau of census and statistics [58] 
between 1917 and 1959 afterwards data was taken from Etemad et al. 
[33]. 
Data for total, hydro, geothermal, and nuclear electricity production 
for other countries was obtained from Etemad et al. [33]. Switzerland 
started with a high value of hydroelectricity, so we assumed that the 
share of hydroelectricity for the early years was equal to the average 
share of hydroelectricity for the first five years of available data. For 
medium producer countries for 1900–1960, we assumed electricity not 
generated from hydropower, nuclear or geothermal sources was pro-
duced from coal (except France, Italy, and Norway), as oil was the only 
other credible source, and no large oil producers are classified as me-
dium producers. IEA data from 1960 onwards for OECD countries pro-
vides carrier-level electricity production data for almost all the medium 
producers, the non-OECD exceptions being China, Czechoslovakia, 
India, and South Africa (their IEA data starts in 1971). 
Small producers comprise all remaining countries that, individually, 
each produced less than 1% of world electricity in 1920 and 1970. For 
small producers, total electricity and hydroelectricity values were taken 
from Etemad et al. [33], with the exception of hydroelectricity values for 
Latin America which were obtained from Rubio and Tafunell [59]. The 
share of thermoelectricity produced by each energy carrier was assumed 
equal to the weighted average of medium and large producers, including 
only non-hydro energy carriers. 
2.2. Primary energy stage: From final-to-primary exergy 
Primary energy gives information about the resources necessary to 
produce the energy we purchase (final energy, such as electricity). 
Moving from final-to-primary energy requires electricity generation ef-
ficiencies for fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) and renewables (e.g., 
hydro). 
For Japan, UK, USA, and USSR (the largest producers) for 
1900–1970, fossil fuel electricity generation efficiencies were calculated 
directly from available primary energy consumption and electricity 
production data. For these countries, we had both primary and final 
energy so there was no need to use efficiencies to estimate primary 
energy. However, for Canada, Germany, and all medium producers, 
primary-to-final efficiencies were obtained from Etemad et al. [33] as 
primary energy data were not available. The same method was used for 
small producers for 1900–1970, with electricity generation efficiencies 
for each energy source taken from Etemad et al. [33] assuming that 
these countries had the lowest efficiency recorded for each year. From 
1971 onwards, the IEA [34] has data on primary energy for electricity 
production for all countries. 
For renewables, three options exist for estimating the equivalent 
primary energy source value: resource content method (RCM), physical 
content method (PCM) and partial substitution method (PSM) [29]. We 
choose the most commonly used option: PCM, the method used by the 
IEA. In the PCM definition, primary energy is the first form of energy 
that is commercially available, meaning wind and solar gross electricity 
produced is considered primary energy [29], with no losses from 
primary-to-final energy stage. 
Last, we convert from primary energy to primary exergy, via multi-
plication of exergy coefficients, shown in Table 1 [23,60]. 
1 Germany data started with a high value of hydroelectricity production, 
suggesting hydroelectricity production began before 1920, but as no sources 
were found for the period prior to 1920 we assume the share of Germany’s 
hydroelectricity prior to 1920 was equal to the average of the period 
1920–1925.

2.3. Useful energy stage: Final-to-useful exergy 
To move from final exergy to useful exergy, we multiply by end-use 
efficiencies. Useful exergy (also called useful work) is defined as “the 
minimum amount of work (or exergy) required to produce a given en-
ergy transfer” [17, p.2]. Unfortunately, data in yearbooks and other 
statistical sources rarely allocates final energy to end-use tasks. Avail-
able references sometimes allocate electricity to the sector or subsector 
in which it is consumed. Thus, the first step was collecting data for the 
consumption of electricity in sectors and subsectors from multiple 
sources for 1900–1971 [22,23,37–40,42,44,47,48,50,56,58,61–65]. 
Detailed descriptions of country-level references are given in Table A1 of 
SI A. After 1971, sectoral electricity consumption is available from the 
IEA [34]. Refer to Sections A2.1 and A2.2 of SI A for a more detailed 
description of the methodology used for allocating electricity con-
sumption to sectors and subsectors. 
The second step was the allocation to end-uses within each sector 
and subsector. We considered the following 10 end-uses: lighting, 
communication and electronics, electrochemical, high temperature heat 
(HTH), low temperature heat (LTH), cooling, transport, residential ap-
pliances, commercial appliances, and machine tools and pumps. Allo-
cation to end-uses was previously completed for Portugal and the USA 
[22,23]. Electricity consumption in residential and commercial sectors 
for the remaining countries was allocated to end-uses using Ayres et al. 
[22] without modification. Electricity consumption in industrial sub-
sectors was allocated to end-uses assuming one main end-use for each 
subsector: HTH for iron and steel, electrochemical for the electro-
chemistry and electrometallurgy industries, and machine tools and 
pumps for other industries. All industrial subsectors have end-uses of 
varying proportion among lighting, communication/electronics, and 
cooling, with shares taken from the industrial sector of Ayres et al. [22]. 
A more detailed description is available in section A2.3 of the SI A. 
The last step was the calculation of useful exergy via multiplying 
end-use electricity consumption by associated final-to-useful exergy ef-
ficiencies. Final-to-useful exergy efficiencies were calculated with the 
equations in Table 2 or obtained from the literature [22,35]. Exergy 
efficiencies for heating/cooling end-uses depend on the temperature of 
the surrounding environment and that required for the task. Different 
end-use temperatures were used depending on the end-use application. 
Refrigeration and space cooling efficiencies were calculated by dividing 
an average real Coefficient of Performance (COP) for machines in each 
year by the ideal COP shown in Table 2. For refrigerators, the ideal COP 
was calculated assuming that a third of the electricity was consumed by 
the freezer, at −18 ◦C, while the remaining two thirds were consumed by 
the cooler at 5 ◦C, following Palma [32]. The environmental tempera-
ture was assumed to be 20 ◦C. For space cooling, the ideal COP was 
calculated assuming a 25 ◦C environmental temperature and 20 ◦C 
end-use temperature. End-use temperatures for heating were taken as 
100 ◦C for cooking, 60 ◦C for water heating and 20 ◦C for space heating. 
LTH exergy efficiencies were calculated assuming an energy efficiency, 
ƞ, of 100% and a Carnot efficiency based on the end-use temperature 
(T1) and environment temperature (T0). For cooking and water heating, 
T0 was taken as the average annual world temperature. For space 
heating, T0 was taken as the average world temperature for the coldest 
month of each year. HTH exergy efficiencies were calculated by multi-
plying the energy efficiency from Ayres et al. [22] by the Carnot effi-
ciency from Table 2. T1 was assumed to be 500 ◦C and T0 the average 
world annual temperature. A table with the references for exergy effi-
ciency per end-use is available in section A2.4 of the SI A as well as more 
details about real COP values [73]. 
2.4. Carbon intensity 
To estimate CO2 emissions, we used Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) emission factors [66], which do not include the 
life cycle emissions for each electricity production technology. Thus, 
renewable technologies have emission factors equal to zero. Due to lack

of data, we do not take into account upstream emissions from fossil fuels. 
In 2000, these emissions represented between 10% and 25% of the direct 
emissions of a power plant, depending on the fuel and country consid-
ered [67,68]. Thus, carbon intensity is the ratio of direct emission-
s/exergy, calculated at both the final stage (CIF) and the useful stage 
(CIU) [23]. 
3. Results 
This section contains results obtained for electricity production and 
consumption as well as efficiencies and carbon intensities associated 
with electricity use. The data used to create each graph is available in SI 
B. This section is focused on overall trends while a detailed discussion of 
shorter-term trends is left to section 4. 
3.1. World electricity production 
Fig. 5 shows world shares of electricity production by energy source 
(left axis) and total electricity production (right axis). Fossil fuels (in 
grey scale colours) are responsible for a relatively stable fraction of 
electricity production (about 60%) from 1900 to 2017. Renewables, 
especially wind, have increased their share in the last decade. The fuel 
sources for electricity production have become more varied through 
time. 
3.2. World electricity consumption 
3.2.1. Allocation to sector and subsector 
Fig. 6 shows the allocation of electricity consumption by subsector. 
The share of electricity consumption in the transport sector decreased 
significantly from 1900 (27.7%) to 2017 (1.7%). In contrast, con-
sumption by residential and commercial sectors increased from a com-
bined share of 23.5% in 1900 to 48.4% in 2017. The sum of industry 
subsectors (iron and steel, electrochemistry and electrometallurgy, and 
other industries) decreased little from 1900 (47.3%) to 2017 (41.9%). 
Total electricity consumption in Fig. 6 (green line, right axis) shows a 
similar trend compared to Fig. 5, where total electricity production is 
shown - the differences are Fig. 6 excludes transmission losses and 
electricity self-consumed by the energy industry. The average value of 
transmission losses was 9.1% of electricity produced, while electricity 
used in the energy industry was on average 8.6% of electricity produc-
tion, see section A1.2 of the SI A. Both electricity production and con-
sumption are part of the final energy stage of the energy conversion 
chain. 
The sharp rise in the electrochemistry and electrometallurgy and 
iron and steel industries at the expense of other industries after 1971 is 
due to classifications of the IEA data. The IEA data contain a level of 
detail that enables allocation of a larger share of other industries to the 
two subsectors, especially for the USSR. 
3.2.2. Allocation to end-uses 
Fig. 7 shows electricity consumption shares by individual end-uses. 
The share of lighting end-uses decreased throughout the period by 
more than half. Transport has decreased markedly (1/20th of the 1900 
share), because electric trams were replaced by automobiles. By 2017, 
HTH end-uses were less than one third of their share in 1900. On the 
other hand, LTH and cooling end-uses have increased significantly, 
representing over 10% and 15% of total consumption, respectively, in 
2017. By comparison in 1900, LTH had no share of electricity con-
sumption and cooling had less than 3% share. Communication and 
electronics and residential appliances end-uses shares experienced a 
similar increase from less than 1% to close to 10%. Commercial appli-
ances end-use share almost doubled to 5% in 2017. The share for ma-
chine tools and pumps has varied considerably. Looking only at 1900 
and 2017, it increased from 23% to 29%. Electrochemical end-uses have 
remained largely stable over the period (average ~4%). 
3.3. Electricity efficiencies 
3.3.1. World primary-to-final exergy efficiencies for fossil fuels 
Fig. 8 shows the evolution of primary-to-final exergy efficiency for 
fossil electricity generation. Average efficiency has grown over the last 
117 years, mainly due to improvements in electricity generating tech-
nology and with a smaller importance the increasing share of higher- 
efficiency generation. The sudden increase in oil efficiency in 1913 is 
related to a change in source for Russia while the decrease in 1997 is due 
to IEA data classifications. The jump in efficiency in 1971 is due to the 
switch in pre/post IEA datasets. 
3.3.2. World primary-to-final, final-to-useful and primary-to-useful exergy 
efficiencies 
Fig. 9 shows primary-to-final, final-to-useful, and overall exergy ef-
ficiencies. As electricity production has been dominated by fossil fuel 
sources since 1900, primary-to-final exergy efficiency follows a similar 
pattern to average fossil fuel exergy efficiency, Fig. 8. 
Final-to-useful exergy efficiency remains surprisingly stable, within

the range 40–50% over the whole period. In 1900, efficiency was 44% 
and in 2017 it was approximately 47%. 
In the period 1900–2017, primary-to-useful exergy efficiency grew 
significantly reaching 17% in 2017. 
3.3.3. Final-to-useful exergy efficiencies per end-use 
Fig. 10 shows final-to-useful exergy efficiencies for each end-use. The 
LTH line shows a decreasing efficiency trend, until the 1980’s, followed 
by a period of constant efficiency and more recently, after the early 
2000’s, a slow increasing trend is observed. This pattern is a result of the 
variable shares of the different LTH uses. LTH is composed of three 
different uses: cooking, water heating, and space heating. A decrease in 
cooking use translated to diminishing share of LTH, whilst space heating 
and water heating weights increased. Water heating and (especially) 
space heating are less efficient than cooking, because of the lower 
temperature of use, causing the decrease in overall LTH exergy effi-
ciency seen until the 1980s. The small increase in efficiency observed 
after the early 2000’s is again a result of a change in weights of LTH end- 
uses, as space heating reduced its importance while water heating 
increased. The efficiency of cooling end-uses decreased between the 
mid-1950s and 1970 due to decreases in refrigeration efficiency because 
of increasing refrigerator and freezer size and new additional features 
[69]. 
3.3.4. Final-to-useful exergy efficiencies for each sector 
Fig. 11 shows the electricity efficiency for the different sectors and 
the aggregated final-to-useful efficiency. The industrial and transport 
sectors have higher efficiencies than the global average. The transport 
sector has mainly one end-use, transport end-use, which is a highly 
efficient end-use. Industry is mainly composed of HTH use, electro-
chemical and machine tools and pumps end-uses. High efficiency ma-
chine tools and pumps have the largest share, leading to high efficiency 
for the industrial sector. The residential and commercial sectors had 
distinct historical differences in terms of efficiency but have since 
evolved into a similar sectoral final-to-useful efficiency. These two 
sectors have low efficiencies because of the significant share of low

efficiency end-uses: lighting, LTH, cooling and communication and 
electronics. 
Figures with allocation per end-use for each sector/subsector are 
available at section A4.1 of the SI A. The variability in efficiencies of the 
residential and commercial sectors are associated with fluctuations of 
individual end-use shares, which are retrieved directly from Ayres et al. 
[22]. 
3.4. Carbon intensity and carbon dioxide emissions 
Fig. 12 (right axis) shows the exponential growth of world CO2 
emissions associated with electricity production for 1900–2017. Fig. 12 
(left axis) also illustrates how carbon intensity has decreased during this 
period. Two different metrics are shown: one considers carbon intensity 
at the final stage of the energy conversion chain (CIF) while the other 
takes one step forward and calculates carbon intensity at the useful level 
(CIU). Carbon intensity, both at the useful stage and final stage, has a 
descending trend for 1900–2017 but both also exhibit stabilization since 
the 1980s, with slight decrease of carbon intensity in the last 5 years. 
Looking at the whole period 1900–2017, CIF dropped from 5.23 to 0.49 
kg CO2/kWh while the CIU decreased from 13.18 to 1.24 kg CO2/kWh. 
3.5. Annual growth rates 
Fig. 13 shows that there has never been a period when primary-to- 
useful exergy efficiency growth has led to CO2 emissions decline, since 
the CO2 growth rate has never been negative. Fig. 13 also shows the lack 
of correlation between primary-to-useful exergy efficiency and CO2 
emissions, especially after 1940. Primary-to-useful exergy efficiency 
growth rate was close to zero, less than 0.5%/year, in the 1940s and 
between 1970 and 2010. The result holds for primary-to-final and final- 
to-useful exergy efficiencies, as shown in Figures A7 and A8 of SI A. 
4. Discussion 
In this section we will look in detail at the results shown above and 
will go through them using a historical perspective first and then 
zooming in to electricity efficiency and transitions. We will also discuss 
some limitations associated with this work.

4.1. Historical perspective 
The construction of the world long-run electricity production and 
consumption database enables consideration of the evolution of elec-
tricity production, consumption, and efficiency since the beginning of 
the 20th century. We see two distinct periods: 1900–1950 and 
1950–2017. 
Between 1900 and 1950, on average, over 95% of the world elec-
tricity was produced from coal and hydro sources, with approximately 
constant shares (coal representing 55% and hydro 40%) (Fig. 5). From 
1900 to 1950 primary-to-final exergy efficiency increased significantly, 
from 6% to 31%, caused by efficiency improvements in thermal power 
plants (blue line Fig. 9). During this period, the industrial sector 
increased its share of electricity consumption at the expense of the 
transport sector (Fig. 6). Within the industrial sector, iron and steel 
decreased its share more than 10% (Fig. 6). These sectoral changes in-
fluence end-uses, with significant increases in the share of machine tools 
and pumps and cooling end-uses, while end-uses for transport and HTH 
decreased their share significantly (Fig. 7). Final-to-useful exergy effi-
ciency increased only slightly from 1900 (44%) to 1950 (47%) (orange 
line Fig. 9), due to efficiency dilution effects. Final-to-useful exergy ef-
ficiency reached a peak in 1940 and declined thereafter (orange line 
Fig. 9), this peak is associated with a peak in the share of the end-use 
machine tools and pumps. Primary-to-useful exergy efficiency, the 
product of both efficiencies, increased sharply (grey line Fig. 9), mostly 
due to the increase of primary-to-final exergy efficiency. Carbon in-
tensity decreased to 0.85 kgCO2/kWh (CIF) and 2.13 kgCO2/kWh (CIU) 
respectively by 1950, less than 1/5th of their 1900 values (orange and 
blue lines Fig. 12), mainly because of primary-to-final efficiency im-
provements. Nonetheless, CO2 emissions increased 24-fold during this 
period due to the near 150-fold increase in electricity production (grey 
line Fig. 12 and green line Fig. 5). 
In the second period (1950–2017), electricity production from nu-
clear, oil, and (more recently) natural gas sources rose in prominence 
(Fig. 5). Whilst in the last decade (2007–2017) solar and wind have 
become more important, their combined share remains less than 10% 
(Fig. 5). Primary-to-final exergy efficiency increased significantly in the 
1950–1960 decade, due to efficiency improvements in thermal power 
plants, and stabilized until 1970 (blue line Fig. 9). After an increase in 
the early 1970s, primary-to-final exergy efficiency stalled during the 
following 40 years, rising slightly after 2005 (blue line Fig. 9) because of 
increasing (a) fossil fuel thermal powerplant efficiency and (b) share of 
solar/wind based electricity – which via the PCM method assumes 100% 
primary-to-final efficiency. Comparative results using PSM and RCM 
methods show similar results and can be seen in section A4.2 of the SI A. 
Throughout 1950–2017, residential and commercial sectors 
increased their shares of electricity consumption, at the expense of the 
industrial sector (Fig. 6). These sectoral changes have impacted end-uses 
as seen in the significant increase of the LTH end-use associated with the 
increase of the residential and commercial sectors (Fig. 7). On the other 
hand, the share of the machine tools and pumps end-uses decreased 
sharply due to the decrease in share of the industrial sector (Fig. 7). 
Between 1950 and 2017, cooling end-use share grew only 3% but 
experienced a change in relative importance of its two constituents: the 
relative weight of refrigeration reduced, while space cooling grew. 
Final-to-useful exergy efficiency varied between 46% and 50% during 
this period but remained overall stable (orange line Fig. 9), due to ef-
ficiency dilution effects. Primary-to-useful exergy efficiency increased 
until 1960, caused by the increase in primary-to-final exergy efficiency 
and stabilized afterwards (grey line Fig. 9). In 2017, carbon intensity 
was almost half the 1950 value (orange and blue lines Fig. 12). CIF 
declined continuously until 1985. From 1950 to 1970, the decline in CIF 
is caused by growing primary-to-final efficiency while from 1971 to 
1985, carbon intensity improvements are explained by an increase in the 
share of electricity production with no CO2 emissions, mostly nuclear 
power. Although carbon intensity, CIF and CIU, stabilized between 1985 
and 2014 (orange and blue lines Fig. 12), electricity production was not 
flat (green line in Fig. 5). In fact, electricity production more than 
doubled and therefore total electricity-based CO2 emissions also more 
than doubled, between 1985 and 2014. The most recent decline in 
carbon intensity (2014–2017) is caused by growth in wind and solar 
electricity. 
4.2. Electricity efficiency 
End-use efficiency (i.e. more energy efficient cars, lights, heating 
etc.) is commonly assumed to be a key driver of (primary and final) 
energy reductions (and associated carbon emissions) in future scenarios 
[2,3,13]. In contrast, our results show that: (1) individual exergy effi-
ciencies grew throughout 1900–2017 (with the exception of LTH and 
cooling) due to technological evolution, but aggregate primary-to-useful 
exergy efficiency gains were significant only until mid 1930s (pri-
mary-to-useful exergy efficiency grew 10% from 1900 until 1935 and 
only 4% in the period 1935–2017) and (2) there is no obvious correla-
tion between aggregate primary-to-useful exergy efficiency, electricity 
consumption and CO2 emissions (Fig. 13).

Two different stories have unfolded: primary-to-final exergy effi-
ciency increased by a factor of 7, mainly in the period 1900–1960, and 
stayed quite stable thereafter. Final-to-useful exergy efficiency increased 
only slightly during the whole period from 44% (1900) to 47% (2017). 
This near stagnation was due to efficiency dilution, where growing de-
mand for less efficient end-uses (LTH and cooling) in residential and 
commercial sectors offset efficiency gains of end-use devices. 
To our knowledge, this study is the first to estimate world electricity 
production and consumption efficiency over a long period. Other studies 
have looked to specific countries for shorter time periods. The results 
obtained for final-to-useful exergy efficiency for the USA in Ayres et al. 
[22] also show that final-to-useful exergy efficiency remained approxi-
mately constant during 1900–2000, due to the increase in LTH end-uses. 
Felício et al. [23] show Portugal’s final-to-useful efficiencies are similar 
in 1900 and 2014. Between those two years there is variation but, in the 
beginning, (1900), and in the end (2014) of the period final-to-useful 
efficiencies are both close to 30%. However, while world 
final-to-useful exergy efficiency has remained constant since 2000, 
Portugal’s show a continuous decrease, due to the growth of the resi-
dential sector share. Our world results do not show a decrease in 
primary-to-final exergy efficiency as found in the the long-term study for 
Japan [25], because hydro was not as significant at the world level as in 
Japan. Regarding primary-to-useful exergy efficiency, we estimate an 
increase of 1% for 1960–2010, in line with the result for China [28], 
USA, and UK [26]. 
Global electricity consumption is expected to rise from 19% in 2022 
to more than 40% of total final energy consumption by 2050 [2,3]. The 
increase of electrification may contribute to an increase in the aggregate 
final-to-useful exergy efficiency, because electricity end-uses typically 
have higher final-to-useful exergy efficiencies compared to other 
end-uses. Additionally, the mix of end-uses provided by electricity will 
change significantly which might push the electricity final-to-useful ef-
ficiency upwards if the increase in the electrification of transport dom-
inates the transition. 
4.3. Transitions 
The time series of world electricity production and consumption 
provides insight into future energy transitions, in particular electrifica-
tion, renewables, and efficiency as potential drivers of decarbonization. 
In the future, electrification of end-uses will create structural changes to 
electricity consumption, with an increase in the share of electricity 
consumption for the transport sector. Indeed, the transport sector share 
is expected to reach over 20% of total electricity consumption by 2050, 
while commercial and residential sectors are expected to decrease their 
share [2]. Under those assumptions, aggregate world final-to-useful 
exergy efficiency would increase because the transport sector is ex-
pected to remain more efficient than the commercial and residential 
sectors (Fig. 11). 
The IEA forecasts predict that electricity production will double 
between 2020 and 2050 [2]. The past increase in electricity production, 
which doubled between 1990 and 2017 suggests that the IEA scenario is 
feasible. In contrast, Jacobson et al. [13] states that if we transition 
totally to electricity by 2050, electrify all end-uses currently using fossil 
fuels, we will reduce final energy demand by more than 50%, compared 
to a business-as-usual scenario but tripling electricity consumption be-
tween 2020 and 2050 would require an increase in electricity produc-
tion higher than observed in the past. 
But will electrification and efficiency be enough to meet decarbonization 
needed? Fig. 13 shows efficiency alone has never been sufficient to 
decrease CO2 emissions, with no observed historical correlation between 
rising primary-to-useful exergy efficiency and CO2 emissions decline 
(Fig. 13). Our results suggest electrification and efficiency must be 
linked with a deep renewables transition if decarbonization is to occur. 
We know that a large-scale transition to renewables must happen 
quickly (10–20 years) to meet Paris climate objectives. However, Fig. 5 
shows that transition has been slow and too small to reduce electricity- 
related CO2 emissions, which have increased almost every year. On 
average across 1900–2017, 60% of electricity was produced using fossil 
fuels (Fig. 5). There has been slowly increasing share of oil-based elec-
tricity in the 1960s and early 1970s, nuclear electricity in the 1970s and 
1980s, and natural gas based electricity in the 1990s until 2010. 
Recently, there is a small increase in the share of renewables. Whilst 
moving through decreasing carbon intensities of fuels (coal-oil-nuclear- 
gas and now to renewables) are positive steps, past transitions have not 
been sufficiently large to reduce electricity-related CO2 emissions, 
which have increased almost every year (grey line Fig. 12). 
Carbon intensity of electricity is an insufficient metric to assess 
transitions if the goal is reducing CO2 emissions. During 1900–2017, 
world carbon intensity dropped by around 90% (orange and blue lines 
Fig. 12), a result similar to Felício et al. [23] results for Portugal. Ang 
and Su [70] found similar results at the world level 1990–2013 for 
carbon intensity at the final stage. However, carbon emissions increased 
380-fold since 1900, as electricity production had a much larger 
(4000-fold) increase since 1900. Historically, rising demand for elec-
tricity (driven by economic growth and electrification of end-uses) has 
always outstripped the capability of efficiency to reduce CO2 emissions. 
In 2017, carbon intensity of electricity production was 0.49 kgCO2/ 
kWh. Using the IRENA scenario for 2050 [3] a carbon intensity of 0.10 
kgCO2/kWh is required, implying a further reduction of 0.39 
kgCO2/kWh - a fifth of its current value, in less than 40 years. When we 
compare to the decrease of 0.12 kgCO2/kWh between 1977 and 2017, 
the tremendous challenge ahead is obvious. The necessary speed of 
decrease of carbon intensity to meet Paris objectives is unprecedented. 
4.4. Limitations 
Final-to-useful exergy efficiency depends on the allocation to sectors, 
and it also depends on the allocation to end-uses within the sectors. 
Regarding allocation to sectors, IEA data were available after 1971 [34], 
while before 1971 information for various countries was collected as 
described in sections 2.3 of this paper and A2.1 of SI A. Considering 
allocation to end-uses within each sector and subsector, we assumed the 
USA as a proxy, except for the industrial sector where we used the 
allocation to subsectors that were country-specific. For the residential 
and commercial sectors, we used USA data to allocate sectoral con-
sumption to end-uses. Although the USA is unlikely to be representative 
of the sectoral electricity consumption patterns in every country, errors 
associated with this assumption are minimized at the world level, 
because the USA consumes a large share (36%) of world electricity 
production on average over the time period of this study. 
One way to estimate the uncertainty of our results is to undertake a 
full sensitivity analysis, as for example done by Paoli et al. [71] but the 
necessary data are not available, as in the past the uncertainty estimates 
were not provided with statistics. Paoli et al. [71] state that “the main 
source of uncertainty is found in the allocation to end-use applications”. 
Therefore, to provide a check on the sensitivity of our results regarding 
the allocation to end-uses within the residential sector, we replaced al-
locations for every country except the US with allocations for Portugal 
[23]. The results obtained were not significantly different: an average 
final-to-useful exergy efficiency of 47.1% compared to 48.4% and a 
similar trend. The differences between the two final-to-useful exergy 
efficiency curves can be seen in section A4.4 of the SI A. 
Other possible sources of uncertainty are the final-to-useful indi-
vidual exergy efficiencies. To evaluate the sensitivity of our study, we 
changed the efficiency of the end-use with the largest share (see Fig. 7), 
machine tools and pumps. We changed the efficiency of machine tool 
and pumps by 10% (for example in 1900 the efficiency went from 75% 
to 82.5%) and obtained an average aggregate final-to-useful exergy ef-
ficiency of 48.4% ± 2.8%. Additionally, this change did not affect the 
overall trend of stagnation, see section A4.5 of the SI A for the 
comparison.

This paper is only focused on electricity which means that our results 
do not quantify the evolution of overall efficiency (efficiency consid-
ering all final energy sources including oil, coal, etc.) and are insufficient 
to evaluate the impact of switching from other fuels to electricity. 
5. Conclusions 
This work produced a novel long-run 1900–2017 global electricity 
dataset that relates primary energy sources to final and useful energy 
flows. We presented new figures for electricity production and con-
sumption at a sectoral level, primary to final and final to useful exergy 
efficiencies and final and useful carbon intensities of electricity. The 
most striking finding is that world electricity energy efficiency 
(measured as overall primary-to-useful exergy efficiency) has stalled, 
rising dramatically from 2% in 1900 to 15% in 1960, and remaining 
nearly stable for the last 50 years, only reaching 17% by 2017. The rapid 
efficiency gain in the 1900–1960 period was due to the 6-fold rise (from 
6% to 36%) in primary-to-final electricity efficiency (mainly due to 
improvements in power station efficiency), as final-to-useful exergy ef-
ficiency was stable, with an average of 48%, over 1900–2017. In the last 
50 years, the stagnation of both electricity generation (primary-to-final) 
exergy efficiency and end use (final-to-useful) exergy efficiency means 
that the overall (primary-to-useful) electricity efficiency has remained 
stable (15–17%) since 1960. Carbon intensities decreased significantly 
until 1960, mainly due to increases in power station (primary-to-final) 
energy conversion efficiency. In 2017, carbon intensities at the final and 
useful energy stages were less than 10% their 1900 values. However, to 
reach climate goals, a further decrease in carbon intensity to 20% of 
current values (2% of 1900 values) is necessary before 2050. 
The cause of the final-to-useful exergy efficiency stagnation in the 
past is efficiency dilution caused by structural transitions and end-use 
changes, such as the increasing share of low-temperature heating 
caused by the increasing share of overall electricity consumption in the 
residential and commercial sectors and the decreasing importance of 
static mechanical work associated with the decrease in the share of the 
industrial sector. The empirical result shows that final-to-useful effi-
ciency has stalled because it has been significantly dependent on the 
type of end-uses that were electrified, suggesting that future energy ef-
ficiency may be mostly dictated by the mix of end-uses. The result em-
phasizes that technological developments alone will not be the only 
factor in changing aggregated electricity efficiency. Instead, shares of 
key electrified technologies (transport, low-temperature heat and ICT) 
in electricity consumption will have significant impacts on changing 
aggregate electricity efficiencies upwards or downwards. Whether 
overall efficiency increases or decreases will depend on technological 
and policy choices and development patterns. For example, a crucial 
question is whether developing and emerging economies will follow the 
path of their forerunners. If developing economies become more service 
based and expansion of household low-temperature heat and cooling 
applications continue, we may expect end-use efficiencies to drop. On 
the other hand, if developing economies leapfrog to electric cars and 
avoid pollution intensive modes of transportation, end-use efficiencies 
may increase and a brighter future might emerge. Our results show that 
there is a need for a deeper investigation of the full impact of electrifi-
cation on world energy efficiency. A follow-on study that includes the 
remaining energy carriers (coal, oil, natural gas and biomass) will 
enable comparisons among electricity and other energy carriers’ effi-
ciencies by end-uses and forecasts of the full impact of electrification on 
overall efficiency due to the forthcoming energy transition. 
Overall, our study raises crucial questions for future renewable 
electricity transitions. It is known that the key drivers of previous 
transitions have been cheaper and/or better energy services [72]. (E.g., 
electricity-altered production processes allowed radical reconfigura-
tions of the factory floor [72].) It seems fair to ask whether electrifica-
tion of transport and heating end uses could be driven similarly at 
sufficient speed by a demand-side clamour for improved transportation 
and heating services. If so, will climate policies be sufficient to drive a 
supply-side transition to renewable sources for electricity generation at 
sufficient speed to keep pace with demand-side electrification? Our re-
sults show that the rate of increase in electricity production between 
1900 and 2017 was 7.4%/year. However, between 1990 and 2017 the 
rate of increase in electricity production was 2.9%/year which is higher 
than the rate needed for the electrification of the world energy system 
under IEA net zero emission scenario [2], 1.8%/year, but lower than the 
rate of increase of electricity production necessary to reach nearly total 
electrification as described in Jacobson et al. [13], which is 3.4%/year, 
and much lower than the rate of increase outlined in Ram et al. [12], 
5.2%/year. Additionally, the fastest transitions in the electricity gener-
ation mix were the increase in fossil fuel share in the 1950s and 1960s 
and the increase in nuclear share in the 1960s and the 1970s, none of 
which exceeded 1%/year. The transition to non-hydro renewables has 
been significant after the mid-2000s, rising from 0.6% to more than 6% 
of total electricity production, however the increases in share have not 
exceeded 1%/year, highlighting the need for a massive investment in 
renewables and a significant decrease in new fossil fuel generation. Both 
the electrification of end-uses and the transition to renewables are 
required to meet Paris targets. The results presented above show that 
doing both at sufficient speed will be unprecedented.

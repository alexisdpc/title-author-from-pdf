The search is on for eﬀective speciﬁc inhibitors for PI3Ka mutants. PI3Ka, a critical lipid kinase, has two
subunits, catalytic and inhibitory. PIK3CA, the gene that encodes the p110a catalytic subunit is a highly
mutated protein in cancer. Dysregulation of PI3Ka signalling is commonly associated with tumorigenesis
and drug resistance. Despite its vast importance, only recently the FDA approved the ﬁrst drug (alpelisib
by Novartis) for breast cancer. A second (GDC0077), classiﬁed as PI3Ka isoform-speciﬁc, is undergoing
clinical trials. Not surprisingly, these ATP-competitive drugs commonly elicit severe concentration-
dependent side eﬀects. Here we brieﬂy review PI3Ka mutations, focus on PI3K drug repertoire and
propose new, to-date unexplored PI3Ka therapeutic strategies. These include (1) an allosteric and
orthosteric inhibitor combination and (2) taking advantage of allosteric rescue mutations to guide drug
discovery.
Introduction
Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3Ks) are lipid kinases that
phosphorylate signaling lipid PIP2 to PIP3.1 PIP3 molecules
recruit proteins bearing PIP3-binding pleckstrin homology (PH)
domains such as Akt in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
to the plasma membrane. The PI3K pathway is among the most
frequently activated in human cancers, impacting almost 50%
of the malignancies.2 Class IA isoforms PI3Ka, b and d are
particularly strongly associated with cancer.3 Activating muta-
tions in the PIK3CA gene,4 which encodes the p110a catalytic
subunit
of
PI3Ka
and
suppressing
mutations
of
tumor
suppressor PTEN5,6 (a lipid phosphatase that dephosphorylates
PIP3, thus opposes PI3Ka action) are the second and third most
frequently mutated in cancer, making PI3Ka a vastly important
target for drug discovery.7,8 However, despite considerable
eﬀorts, to date the clinical outcome of PI3K inhibitor-based
treatments1 for solid tumors has been disappointing. Reasons
include drug resistance such as that resulting from PTEN
suppression and lack of specicity thus intolerable toxicity,
making innovative drug development a major aim of the
pharmaceutical industry. Structural understanding of PI3Ka
activation mechanism under physiological conditions and in
the presence of activating oncogenic mutations is expected to
provide a better grasp of its underlying principles toward this
aim. The landmark work of Peter Vogt that has uncovered
mechanistic principles of PI3Ka gain-of-function mutations,
including rare mutations, Roger Williams, who pointed out the
premise that oncogenic mutations mimic and enhance dynamic
events in natural activation of p110a, and Mario Amzel who
solved the rst full PI3Ka structure elucidating oncogenic
mutations have been major steps in this direction.9–12
PI3Ka has two subunits, catalytic (p110) and inhibitory (p85).
PIK3CA, which encodes the p110a, is frequently mutated in
cancer. Dysregulation of the PI3Ka signaling pathway is
commonly associated with tumorigenesis and drug resistance.
Despite its vast importance, only in May 2019 the FDA approved
the rst drug (alpelisib by Novartis) for breast cancer.13 A second
(GDC0077) is undergoing clinical trials. Although the drug has
been classied as PI3K isoform-specic, severe concentration-
dependent side eﬀects are commonly observed. This is not
unexpected. These drugs, like the previously developed ones,
are ATP-competitive and the ATP binding site is almost iden-
tical among PI3K isoforms, and they target a major signaling
pathway in the cell. Recently, it was discovered that double,
triple, and multiple mutations can work conjointly,14 raising key
questions, including why co-occurring mutations, why specic
combinations, and how frequent can such events be in onco-
genic proteins. Remarkably, alpelisib was observed to potently
aﬀect the signaling strength of particular combinations of
mutations when targeting PI3Ka oncogenes, raising the ques-
tion of how the drug works.
Below, we briey discuss the mechanism of PI3Ka activation,
its oncogenic mutations and their combinations. We review
inhibitors developed to block it and their intrinsic oﬀ-target
toxicities, and outline the challenges encountered in isoform-
specic drug discovery. Finally, we propose two new possible
strategies for PI3Ka specic inhibitor development. The rst
combines PI3Ka orthosteric and allosteric drugs; the second
involves allosteric drugs at positions of rescue mutations. Drugs
mimicking the allosteric eﬀects of these mutants may rescue

PI3Ka function in cancer. We further delineate determinants to
accomplish these approaches.
Allostery plays a role in PI3Ka activation
by RTK, but not by Ras
Recently we published in Chem. Sci. an atomistic-level mecha-
nism of PI3Ka activation.15 In that work we delineated how, via
the phosphorylated motif at the C-terminal of a receptor tyro-
sine kinase (RTK) PI3Ka relieves its autoinhibition by the nSH2
domain and the details of the allosteric population shis of the
PI3Ka ensemble that take place to expose the active site of this
lipid kinase at the membrane. The mechanism further claries
how these conformational changes increase the population of
ATP within a catalytically required distance, permitting phos-
phoryl ion transfer to the signaling lipid PIP2 to produce PIP3. In
addition, it provided the structural role of Ras in PI3Ka
activation.16
Even though the binding of active Ras perturbs the PI3Ka
structure with allosteric propagation that promotes certain
conformational changes,17–21 the key question is whether this
action is the dominant contribution to activation. RTK
recruits PI3Ka to the membrane and promotes conforma-
tional change that relieves the autoinhibition; Ras acts to
stabilize the PIP2 lipid substrate in the relatively shallow
active site that accommodates it. This enhances its pop-
ulation, with the ‘top’ hydrophobic portion of PIP2 projecting
into the plasma membrane. The allosteric conformational
change promoted by Ras is unlikely to play a signicant role
in activation.
Taken together, the detailed PI3Ka activation mechanism
helps in understanding how the strong cancer driver mutations
activate this lipid kinase; why some other observed oncogenic
mutations are weaker drivers, and why certain mutational
combinations are more powerful and more potently targeted by
these drugs. Hotspot mutations E542K and E545K mimic RTK's
action in releasing the autoinhibition. This action promotes the
allosteric conformational changes that expose PI3Ka active site
at the membrane and reduce the barrier height of the transition
state; the H1047R hotspot with a substitution of His by posi-
tively charged Arg mimics Ras' action. The co-acting double
mutations observed by Vasan et al.14 pair a strong hotspot with
one or more weak activation mutations, such as E453Q/K,
E726K and M1043V/I, which either introduce charge reversal
at the membrane, or altered hydrophobicity. The changes of the
residue charge and hydrophobicity strengthen the activation
and signaling. Most of the weak mutations are far away from
both the inhibitory nSH2 in the p85a subunit and the catalytic
site, conrming their allosteric roles in activation. Fig. 1 illus-
trates the PI3Ka structure in the autoinhibited and active states,
with the location of the mutations highlighted (Fig. 1A and B).
While hotspot mutations occur in the helical and kinase
domains, most weak mutations are at the surfaces of the ABD
and C2 domains. ABD and C2 in p110a are responsible for iSH2
interactions. The oncogenic mutations in ABD and C2 domains
imply a more exible iSH2 in activated PI3Ka. The crystal

structures of PI3Ka containing the inhibitory nSH2 may repre-
sent an inactive conformation (Fig. 1C).22–24 The active confor-
mation observed in our simulations following nSH2 release
diﬀers. Remarkably, the sampled PI3Ka active conformation
resembles the crystal structure of PI3Kb with the inhibitory
nSH2 removed (PDB ID 2Y3A), with similar iSH2 and activation
loop (a-loop) conformations (Fig. 1D and E). PI3Kb is inhibited
by both nSH2 and cSH2. The crystal structure of PI3Kb without
the nSH2 domain may represent a partially active conformation
of PI3K,25 implying that PI3K isoforms may share conforma-
tional changes for activation.
PI3Ka activation takes place at the plasma membrane. It is
mediated by interactions with the phosphorylated motif at the
C-terminal of an RTK, Ras and the membrane. The activating
mutations mimic the eﬀects of these binding events. However,
current inhibitors are still stymied by insuﬃcient selectivity, the
outcome of the near identity among the ATP binding sites of the
PI3K isoforms. At the same time, since ATP is the principal
energy currency of the cell with structurally similar cavities
hosting it,26 attempts to overcome these hurdles by higher ATP-
competitive drug levels encounter toxicity. This argues for
allosteric drugs.27–34 Unfortunately, these eﬀorts are yet to
produce eﬀective drugs. Notwithstanding, the encouraging
successes with KRas4B, another hitherto undruggable onco-
genic protein, where creative covalent allosteric drugs target
KRas4BG12C, and discovery of new PI3Ka pockets,27 breed
cautious optimism.
Pan PI3K and PI3Ka inhibitors
Recent reviews provide a comprehensive coverage of pan-PI3K
inhibitors,
PI3Ka
specic
inhibitors
and
PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors, their status and the specic cancers that they
target.35–38 We thus refer the readers to these. Here we provide
a mere brief overview (Fig. 2).
Pan-PI3K inhibitors act on all class I isoforms.38 The
outcome is oﬀ-target side eﬀects and toxicities.37 Depending
on the specic targeted cancer type and its status they include
buparlisib39–41 and pictilisib (GDC-0941) in breast cancer,42,43
and pilaralisib,44–47 copanlisib,48,49 PX866,50–56 CH5132799,57
and ZSTK474 and SF1126 58 in diverse cancers (Fig. 2). Their
lack of isoform specicity makes them toxic albeit to diﬀerent
extents.37,59 Consequently, most were discontinued. Inhibitors
gravitating toward isoform-specicity have lesser oﬀ-target
toxicity. d-Isoform inhibitor idelalisib is one example.37,60,61
Taselisib inhibits primarily p110b with 30-fold lower potency59
but also reduces mutant p110a levels. Alpelisib (BYL719),
described as PI3Ka-specic, is another.62 Alpelisib was also
prescribed in combination with the aromatase inhibitor
letrozole.63 Oﬀ-target toxicities were observed. A combination
with the BRAF inhibitor encorafenib and anti-EGFR mono-
clonal antibody cetuximab pointed to clinical eﬃcacy and
lower toxicity proles.64 Additional combinations were tested
as well, including alpelisib with inhibitors targeting PI3K
pathway proteins,65 although still with side eﬀects. As ex-
pected, at higher concentrations it accomplishes strong PI3K
(80%) inhibition. TAK-117 is another PI3Ka inhibitor.66 The
new PI3Ka inhibitor GDC-0077 currently undergoes clinical
trials in combination with other drugs.67 Further details are
provided in the reviews cited above. Exhaustive structural
analyses of the active sites of all PI3Ka class I isoforms have
also been reviewed and regions that can play a role in selec-
tivity were described in detail.68 Below, we briey overview
them focusing on PI3Ka and the interactions with alpelisib.

PI3Ka ATP binding site and inhibitor
interactions
We illustrate the diﬃculty in optimizing an ATP-competitive
inhibitor specically to the PI3Ka isoform. The ATP binding
sites of class I PI3Ks are highly homologous, diﬀering in only
a few residues at the rim. The respective residues have been
grouped into two regions, Regions 1 and 2.69,70 Non-conserved
residues in the two regions can aid selectivity. The rst non-
conserved Region is near the hinge (four residues). The
second less variable is at the P-loop. The chemical and confor-
mational diﬀerences of these regions among the isoforms
dene their distinct interactions and have been meticulously
probed with the hope that such analyses would help in
improving inhibitor specicity.35 The ATP binding site in PI3K
isoforms is between the two lobes of the kinase domain, which
are separated by a hinge. This is where the adenine ring of ATP
and the inhibitors' rings anchor. The hydrophobic residues are
conserved, but not the neighboring ones. The so-called speci-
city pocket shows certain isoform dependent aﬃnity diﬀer-
ences.71 A conformational change of the P-loop upon inhibitor
binding exposes it.72–74 However, the residues involved are
conserved even though those around the pocket are not and
may be at play in inhibitor design. There are also diﬀerences in
the conformational exibilities. Nonetheless, the opening of the
specicity pocket does not appear as determining inhibitor
selectivity. ATP also does not penetrate the aﬃnity pocket,
which is encircled by the conserved residues.75 Despite this,
inhibitors entering the pocket have higher potency. P-loop
residues play a role in PI3Ka selectivity for GDC-0941,76 which
was subsequently converted into a more selective covalent
drug.77 For PI3Ka the rst non-conserved region appears the
key. An inhibitor that extends towards Region 1 (benzoxazepine)
adjusts selectivity,76,78,79 leading to GDC-0326,67 with the drug's
carboxamide interacting with Gln859, and Ser854 H-bonding
the drug as well.67 Additional drugs and their interactions
have also been described.68
As a detailed example we describe alpelisib, the rst drug to
be approved by the FDA. The crystal structure of PI3Ka with
alpelisib has been solved (PDB ID 4JPS). Alpelisib binds to the
ATP pocket in the kinase domain, with massive contacts with
the P-loop and hinge region. Due to the high sequence simi-
larity in PI3K isoforms, most alpelisib-contacting residues in
PI3Ka
are
conserved,
with
only
ve
variable
residues
(852RNSH855 and Q859) in the hinge region (Fig. 3A and B). Here,
we focus on two residues, R852 and Q859, since the side chains
of the other three residues (NSH) are exposed to solvent and
barely involve in the interactions with alpelisib. Q859 of PI3Ka
forms dual hydrogen bonds with alpelisib (Fig. 3C). Its impor-
tance
in
isoform
selectivity
has
been
indicated
and
conrmed.80,81 This residue becomes shorter in PI3Kb (D856)
and PI3Kd (N836), while the K890 in PI3Kg is still long enough
for the hydrogen bond interaction with alpelisib (Fig. 3D–F).
R852 in PI3Ka forms a salt bridge with E798 in the kinase
domain's N-lobe. A similar salt bridge is observed in PI3Kg
(K831-E814). L829 of PI3Kg also establishes hydrophobic
interactions with M762 and W760. However, PI3Kb is quite
diﬀerent with no favorable interaction of S849. This indicates

that PI3Kg resembles more PI3Ka in those residue contacts,
followed by PI3Kd and PI3Kb. It is interesting that the structural
similarity of the hinge region relates to the selectivity of alpe-
lisib to PI3K isoforms. The IC50 values for PI3Ka (�5 nM) is
highest, followed by PI3Kg (�250 nM), PI3Kd (�290 nM) and
PI3Kb (�1200 nM).81 This emphasizes the signicance of the
hinge region in mediating the isoform selectivity.
In vitro screening of oncogenic mutants has been carried out
and micromolar range binders have been identied.82 However,
they are not mutant-selective. A non-ATP allosteric pocket has been
identied in a crystal structure of PI3Ka (PDB 4A55). It has been
further studied by computational simulations.83 Still, currently its
eﬃcacy has been unclear, leading the authors to conclude that this
binding site is unlikely to yield productive allosteric inhibitors.
Fragment-based screening was also carried out to identify the
allosteric inhibitor pockets with promising results27 with phos-
phopeptide binding at the E542K and E545K hotspots. These
allosteric pockets are summarized in Fig. 4A and B. Here, we
suggest another allosteric pocket. The oncogenic mutations in C2
and ABD suggest the exible iSH2 in the activated PI3Ka, which
has been observed in the simulations of wild type PI3Ka and the
E545K mutant.15,84 The movement of ABD is coupled with the
interacting iSH2 domain in PI3Ka.85 The more stable ABD is ex-
pected to interfere with PI3Ka activation and increase the pop-
ulation of the inactive PI3Ka conformation in the ensemble. By
visualizing the PI3Ka structure, a pocket was identied between
the ABD and the kinase domain's N-lobe. The pocket is deep with
considerable hydrophobicity (Fig. 4C). The involved residues
include 115–123 in the ABD–RBD linker, and 699–715 and 840–845
in the kinase domain's N-lobe. An inhibitor targeting the pocket is
expected to enhance the ABD–kinase domain interface, rendering
a higher stability of ABD and iSH2 to restrict the PI3Ka inactive
conformation and target PI3Ka with ABD mutations.
Orthosteric drug design focused on the ATP binding site,
with attempts to obtain highly isoform specic inhibitors.
However, they encountered an almost impregnable hurdle: the
near identity of the ATP binding sites across isoforms. At the
same time, designing drugs to stably bind at the substrate
binding site is diﬃcult. With part of the PIP2 lipid anchored in
the membrane with high avidity, the substrate binding site is
shallow.
The
membrane-buried
protein
surface
further
constrains small molecule access. Currently available inhibitors
mimicking ATP require high concentrations, resulting in
toxicities. The frequent emerging deletion or mutations of
PTEN, which suppresses cancer by dephosphorylating the PI3K-
phosphorylated lipid PIP3 back to PIP2, which is also with no
currently available inhibitors, aggravates the pharmacological
scenario. PTEN is highly challenging to target: to function the
inhibitor needs to activate, not suppress it. Drug-induced acti-
vation of an enzyme is diﬃcult to accomplish.
To-date unexplored PI3Ka therapies
We propose exploring two new strategies for PI3Ka inhibition:
(i) combination of allosteric and orthosteric drugs and (ii)
taking advantage of rescue mutations to guide drug discovery.
They can also be merged. Below, we describe the background,
rationale, and map a strategy for their implementation.
(i) Allosteric plus orthosteric drugs
A few years ago, a remarkable observation was made: a Cys to
Tyr mutation (C1156Y) in metastatic anaplastic lymphoma
kinase (ALK) desensitized it to crizotinib, an ATP-competitive
drug that was given earlier. Lorlatinib was then prescribed;
however, drug resistance emerged. Sequencing indicated that
an emerging allosteric mutation involving L1198F substitution
conferred resistance to lorlatinib, also an ATP-competitive
small-molecule inhibitor of ALK and the related tyrosine
kinase ROS1. The L1198F mutation led to steric interference

with lorlatinib binding. ALK L1198F has been reported as an
ALK gain-of-function mutation. However, remarkably the allo-
steric L1198F mutation resensitized ALK to crizotinib. The
patient harboring this mutation received crizotinib again, and
the cancer-related symptoms abated.86 In this example L1198F
is a rescue mutation. The mutation redistributed the ALK
conformational ensemble, now re-populating a crizotinib
binding-favored state. In line with this observation, loss of
G2032R resistance mutation upon chemotherapy treatment
enabled successful crizotinib rechallenge in a patient with
ROS1-rearranged cancer.87 Thus, once the mutation occurred,
there is no need for an allosteric drug that would mimic its
action to combine with the ATP-competitive crizotinib. Had
there not been such a mutation at that position, an allosteric
drug mimicking it could conceivably accomplish this role,
promoting a drug-accommodating conformational change at
the ATP binding site. Drug resistance oen emerges from
conformational changes.88 Allosteric drugs can resensitize an
active site in the same way that an allosteric mutation does,
restoring the actions of orthosteric drugs. As we describe below,
experiments in Nathaniel Gray's Lab on BCR-ABL kinase toward
treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) along with
subsequent work provide an outstanding example.
Imatinib, an orthosteric ATP-competitive drug, can inhibit
oncogenic mutants of BCR-ABL. However, mutations oen
aﬀect BCR-ABL's ATP-binding site or the activation loop can
result in drug resistance. Among these, T315 substitutions that
elicit steric clashes with the drug are particularly potent. By
screening drug libraries the Gray team rst identied an allo-
steric drug GNF-2 with similar antiproliferative outcome as the
orthosteric drug.90 Subsequent optimization obtained the allo-
steric GNF-5 compound.90 Remarkably, like the L1198F rescue
mutation in ALK, the GNF drug series shied the protein
ensemble toward an active site that re-sensitized BCR-ABL to
imatinib and nilotinib. NMR, crystallography, mutagenesis and
hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry all indicated that the
drug binds to the C-terminal myristate pocket of BCR-ABL. The
structure unraveled formation of considerable hydrophobic as
well as vdW interactions and water-mediated H-bonds, indi-
cating how the combination of the GNF-series allosteric drug
collaborates with the ATP-competitive imatinib, overcoming the
T315 drug-resistant hotspots.89,90
ABL001 (asciminib) is also a potent and selective allosteric
ABL1 inhibitor that binds to the myristoyl pocket of ABL1 in
a manner resembling the GNF-series. It interacts with active site
residues via the same type of interactions as the GNF inhibitors,
and shis the ensemble toward the inactive kinase conforma-
tion. Each drug alone, ABL001 and the catalytic ATP-competitive
inhibitor nilotinib are blocked by distinct drug resistant
mutations. However, as above, their combination eradicates the
tumors.91 Thus, even though mutations at the myristate site can
confer resistance to ABL001, they are sensitive to nilotinib or
other ATP-competitive inhibitors making their combination (or
ABL001 with other ATP-competitive drugs, like imatinib or
dasatinib) a viable BCR-ABL inhibition strategy.92 Combining
the allosteric inhibitor asciminib with ATP-competitive ponati-
nib was recently found to even more powerfully suppress the
emergence of mutants (Y253H and E255V) and restore eﬃcacy
against
highly
resistant
BCR-ABL1
mutants.93
Additional
examples of such combinations are available.94,95
The concept of allosteric drug working conjointly with an
orthosteric drug is not new. We only need to consider that
a ‘ligand’ can be an orthosteric drug, with the allosteric drug
acting to modulate it.96 This powerful combinatorial concept
has shown promise for the protein kinases above; but has not
been tested for PI3Ka. Allosteric drugs may overcome PI3Ka
drug resistance by altering the ATP binding site and resensi-
tizing it, i.e. making it accessible to sterically blocked ATP-
competitive orthosteric drugs, or by producing an altered,
druggable PIP2 binding site. Cross-correlations of the motions
and analysis of the conformational ensembles in long timescale
molecular dynamics simulations may be one way to help iden-
tify likely targetable allosteric sites.
(ii) Rescue mutations provide a powerful concept
That mutations can rescue, or resensitize, a mutant protein to
an allosteric drug has been shown for a number of diseases. As
such they have been dubbed “natural gene therapy” and
“nature's proof of principle that you can x those mutations” in
the case of Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome (WAS).97 Additional
examples include the p.Q188R mutation in classic galacto-
semia98 that gives rise to a protein with lower conformational
stability
and
lower
catalytic
activity99
and
p53.100
Drugs
mimicking the allosteric eﬀects of these mutants may rescue
function. To the best of our knowledge, in practice this however
has not been followed up, likely due to the design complexity
which is involved. Nonetheless, identifying them in protein
structures, and their potential substitutions will provide allo-
steric sites and potentially certain orthosteric-drug favored
conformational changes. Here we propose attempting this
strategy in targeting PI3Ka.
How to a priori identify the positions of such mutations?
Earlier we have taken this up for von Hippel–Lindau tumor
suppressor protein (pVHL).101 To identify possible candidate
residues, we used molecular dynamics simulations, seeking the
least stable regions in the unbound state of the protein. This
agged the interface between the two domains. We then
designed several stabilizing mutations at the interdomain
interface and in the domains. Experiments showed that disease
mutant Y98N at the HIF binding site destabilizes pVHL and
lowers its aﬃnity to hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). pVHL is part
of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that regulates the degrada-
tion of HIF. The simulations indicated that pVHL stability and
binding aﬃnity are allosterically regulated. We thus sought to
allosterically stabilize pVHL and its interactions with mutations
away from binding sites. The mutations were selected based on
sequence alignment with a pVHL from other species (worm
pVHL sequence). The worm-based substitutions stabilized
pVHL, its Y98N mutant, and the complexes of pVHL with HIF,
lowering its binding free energy, and the Y98N mutant with
elongin C complex, thus rescuing pVHL–HIF aﬃnity and func-
tion. The reason for choosing the worm sequence was our
observation that the worm p53 is signicantly more stable than

the human form.102 In PI3Ka, rescuing mutations could
improve the aﬃnity of the ATP-competitive drug to its binding
site without increasing its concentration, by allosterically
altering
its
conformation.
The
mutations
in
the
kinase
domain's P-loop may be promising. Such a strategy may also be
considered for PTEN tumor suppressor.
Alternative
strategies
and considerations
to
map
and
harness allosteric candidates to improve PI3Ka isoform-specic
inhibitor design were also proposed.103 Key steps in successful
design of allosteric drugs include identication of allosteric
sites103–105 including hidden cryptic allosteric pockets106,107
shown to underlie allosteric modulator selectivity at muscarinic
GPCRs,108

mutations19,109–118
and
allosteric
drug
design.119,120 Allosteric drugs can constitute ‘anchors’ and
‘drivers’.103 The anchor docks into an allosteric pocket whose
conformation is unchanged during the transition between the
inactive and active states. The driver 'pulls' and/or 'pushes'
protein atoms (side-chain or backbone) and triggers shis of
the receptor population to a drug binding-favored state. Based
on crystal structures, characteristics of anchors and drivers have
been outlined. The recent computational tools quantifying the
allosteric signaling, mutation eﬀects and their combinational
actions in the signaling promote the discovery of allosteric
eﬀectors.121,122
Conclusions
To understand the behavior of biomacromolecules we need to
look at the distributions of their conformational ensembles and
how these are aﬀected by their environments. Under physio-
logical conditions PI3Ka populates the inactive state. Onco-
genic mutations will shi the ensemble to populate the active
state. The extent of the shi determines the strength of the
mutation. The chemistry of the surface matters: the membrane
surface is negatively charged, with lipid hydrophobicity playing
a major role. Mutations that contribute positive charge will
enhance the interactions. Mutations (orthosteric or allosteric)
that weaken the interactions of p85a with p110a or between the
p85a domains or strengthen the interaction with the membrane
will shi the population toward the active state. Double (strong
and weak) mutations can act to more fully shi the population.
Drug resistance mutations can alter the ATP binding site,
shiing the ensemble toward orthosteric drug-inaccessible
state. Allosteric modulator drug can shi the population
toward drug accessibility. Rescue mutations can identify regu-
latory hot spots that nature uses for functional control. Small
molecule allosteric inhibitors can take aim at such hot spots in
tough-to-drug targets such as kinases and phosphatases, like
the SHP2.
Here we described the PI3Ka saga from the free energy
landscape standpoint123 and its dynamic shis following
changes in the environment.110,124–126 Allostery is a powerful
ensemble property used by nature. Harnessing it to favor an
ATP-competitive drug exploits “nature's proof of principle” may
be one way to target PI3Ka, the second most highly mutated
protein in cancer. Here we proposed two new possible venues
not exploited yet in PI3Ka drug discovery: allosteric plus
orthosteric drug combinations and following mother nature
rescue mutation strategy.

Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) in breast cancer care - Leveraging
multidisciplinary skills to improve care*
Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) technologies supporting health pro-
fessionals’ skills bring the promise of an era in which repetitive
and time-intensive tasks in healthcare can be automated and per-
formed (either entirely or in part) by AI systems. As automation
progressively facilitates the delivery of health care, physicians can
now focus on more humanized patient care. The use of AI to ensure
quality delivery is essential in the ﬁght against diseases and there is
no doubt that the next decade will see a growing stream of AI ap-
plications across healthcare. “We are not ready for what is about
to come” Coiera tells us [1], a statement highlighting the need for
healthcare practitioners and services to prepare for AI’s adoption
into health practice. With the progress of AI systems, it seems
obvious that machine thinking will invade our workspace, literally
and ﬁguratively, in all areas of breast cancer care. Instead of resist-
ing, we should better consider preparing ourselves for the impact,
the potential, and the pitfalls, and start adapting our work environ-
ment to this new reality. This progress will need big input from
“both sides of the barricade”, namely AI technical experts and
health care professionals.
Fear of the unknown is a common obstacle in innovation and
frequently leads to resistance to new approaches. This is also the
situation with AI in health care, although in this instance, cautious
planning and evaluation are needed to allow us to understand the
most beneﬁcial way to adopt AI in practice. To achieve this, health-
care professionals including doctors need to work closely with AI
experts. However, many doctors are not at ease with the computer
science language, and computer scientists and engineers don’t
master health terminology and concepts. Moreover, these very
divergent skills appear to focus on different objectives. While
health professionals have the primary goal of better diagnosis
and treatment for patients, computer science teams are focused
on inventing methods and computational processes to solve ques-
tions that might, in some instances, be considered of less priority to
those who actually manage patients in real-word health settings.
So, to make progress in our endeavor to use AI to improve various
aspects of clinical care, in general and in our focus on breast cancer,
we need to communicate our different perspectives more efﬁ-
ciently and more effectively. To help solve this problem, a curricu-
lum teaching the language used and the problems addressed both
by AI scientists and healthcare professionals could be implemented
both in pre-graduate and post-graduate education, as highlighted
in the work from Ferreira et al. in this special issue [2].
Many of the subﬁelds of AI in health care are represented in this
collection of papers addressing some of the developments that will
help us in the routine care of breast cancer patients. It is obvious
that many of the tasks that are undertaken very frequently by hu-
man operators with their inherent subjectivity will be the ones
most likely to be replaced successfully in the near future by AI-
based systems.
One of the most relevant ﬁelds of research is the use of image
analysis in various clinical applications including breast imaging,
digital pathology, surgical planning, and outcomes evaluation.
The huge amount of imaging digital data already annotated with
deﬁned characteristics either in screening or diagnosis has allowed
the development of machine-learning-derived solutions that are on
the verge of becoming a part of our practices in the near future.
On the methodological side, contributions to this special issue
come from the papers by Ref. [3,4]. Yap et al. move from a set of ul-
trasound breast images and use an accurate object detection deep
learning framework (namely, Faster-RCNN with Inception-ResNet-
v2): region of interest (ROI) detection and lesion localization are
automatically performed, helping the surgeon to focus on the rele-
vant area of the breast. Carvalho et al. propose a method which de-
ploys phylogenetic diversity indexes, generally used in biology to
compare the behavior patterns of species in different areas, applied
in this work to characterize breast histopathology images: the
resulting model classiﬁes histopathological images of the breast
into four classes - invasive carcinoma, in situ carcinoma, normal tis-
sue, and benign lesion e leaving a possible promise for the future of
reducing the number of needed biopsies.
Other papers in this special issue are also dedicated to the use of
AI in breast imaging, screening, diagnosis, and prognosis as well as
the prediction of cancer response to treatment. These topics are
reviewed and discussed taking into account the current state of
existing applications [5e8]. AI has the potential to bring efﬁciencies
to screening programs burdened by screen-reading workload, and
augmenting radiologists’ interpretation. Various approaches to us-
ing AI in screening are discussed by Sechopoulos and Mann in this
issue [7], while Lee et al. highlight the pathways and processes
needed to ensure validation and diversiﬁcation of algorithms for
screening practice [5].
Applications of machine learning to digital pathology for breast
cancer, including both diagnostic and prognostic applications, will
not only complement the routine work of breast pathologists but
also improve their diagnostic accuracy. As described in the detailed
review by Ibrahim et al. [9], AI in breast cancer pathology will pro-
vide information beyond that can be gained by eyeball assessment
with the potential to replace some of the expensive multigene
assays.
In contrast to imaging and pathology where there are already

available AI tools and substantial applied research, the sub-
specialties in local treatments of breast cancer are relatively lagging
behind in AI applications. It is not surprising that AI work in surgery
is not commensurate with that described for imaging and pathol-
ogy. Operating a breast depends on a number of variables that
are difﬁcult to collect and standardize. An effort has been made
to try to transfer the diagnosis imaging information to the oper-
ating room, allowing more accurate localization of cancer. This
effort has been essentially directed to the fusion of information
coming from surface scans with imaging data from MRI allowing
the construction of a breast model with the tumor inside, as re-
ported by Bessa et al. [10]. Some work has also been done in breast
reconstruction through image analysis of angio CTs, the routine
exam used to plan free ﬂap reconstruction after mastectomy. The
capacity to automatically detect vessels from angio CTs, proposed
by Mavioso et al. will hopefully replace the process of manual anno-
tation by a computerized automatic analysis keeping the same ac-
curacy levels [11].
Concerning radiotherapy, CT images are the core of treatment
planning for each patient, and some facilitating tools already exist
for contouring the ﬁelds of treatment. However, the use of AI to
automate the entire process is not yet used in breast cancer
although it could save many hours of work for the radiation
oncology team. The paper from Poortmans et al. offers a signiﬁcant
contribution to elucidate the issues related to AI applications to
individualize radiation therapy for breast cancer patients [12].
Beyond using image analysis in diagnostic and planning of treat-
ment, we also need tools to assess the clinical outcomes of this de-
cision. Besides the side effects of systemic treatments, the visible
impact of surgery and radiotherapy on patients’ body image is of
major importance for patients. Cardoso and colleagues [13] offer
a review and a discussion of recent advancements in machine
learning, and especially deep learning, bringing new promises to
the ﬁeld of aesthetic outcomes of locoregional treatments.
Decision support systems are advanced systems that help phy-
sicians to diagnose and treat diseases.
In fact, the task of physicians is becoming more and more com-
plex because increasing quantities of data need to be properly
considered before proceeding with any treatment decision. Indeed,
because medical knowledge is advancing, different categories of
cancer are proliferating along with the number of new therapies
stemming from clinical research and new surgery techniques,
which dramatically widen the set of possible choices of decisions.
Decision support systems make use of different methodologies
including artiﬁcial intelligence, knowledge representation, infor-
mation visualization, and text mining, among others. On the meth-
odological side, contributions on decision support systems come
from the papers by Ref. [14,15]. Bouaud et al. report about the re-
sults of the European-funded DESIREE project, providing breast
unit physicians with different complementary therapeutic decision
support modules including guideline-based, experience-based, and
case-based reasoning. Gu et al. propose an auxiliary decision sup-
port system to help doctors improve the accuracy of breast cancer
recurrence prediction.
Big data analysis refers to the analysis of huge quantities of data
which are now collected and stored in any human activity,
including healthcare. Such data can be exploited for different tar-
gets, e.g., to provide medical staff with suggestion support for
care delivery, to reason, and to extract knowledge, as well as to un-
derstand the natural language of textual descriptions such as med-
ical reports.
Papers by Macias-Garcia et al. [16], and Pozzoli et al. [17] offer
signiﬁcant contributions to the methodological side of the big
data topic. Macias-Garcia et al. summarize DNA methylation data
to generate new features from the values of CpG sites of patients,
to predict breast cancer recurrence. Pozzoli et al. experiment unsu-
pervised learning in the detection and analysis of distinctive pro-
teins for the identiﬁcation of cancer subtypes.
Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the capacity of
analyzing free text, i.e., the text in human normal speaking or
writing, and of understanding it and, possibly, of extracting knowl-
edge from it. The main sources for NLP are medical reports, where
non-coded information is depicted. On the methodological side,
one contribution on NLP comes from the paper by Hanyin Wang
et al. [18], where the authors propose an automated method to pre-
dict breast cancer distant recurrence, using natural language pro-
cessing and deep learning approaches applied to pathology
reports and progress notes of some 6000 patients.
Some less established but however emerging and promising
areas of AI applications to breast cancer care are also introduced
into this issue.
Butow and Hoque [19] discuss AI use to assess and deﬁne effec-
tive communication between health professionals and patients.
Both communication and teaching of how to communicate are pro-
cesses that stand essentially on qualitative forms of analysis/evalu-
ation, and the use of machine learning could make these processes
more efﬁcient.
Moser and Nayaran [20] report on the use of machine learning
to detect patterns that help to track the ideal workﬂow for breast
cancer patients from diagnosis to long-term follow-up. The authors
propose that electronic records analysis could bring AI modeling
into clinical practice to drive well-coordinated, patient-centered
cancer care in the complex web of modern healthcare today, yet
stressing the need for human presence along these pathways.
Kakileti et al. [21] propose and analyze a new personalized risk
framework to identify a high-risk target population for regular
screening and enable early stage breast cancer detection at scale.
The approach runs machine learning algorithms to analyze thermal
images, and automatically generates a breast health risk score,
assigning subjects to four different risk classes.
Chiudinelli et al. [22] analyze data extracted from some 3000
electronic health records and describe a care ﬂow mining algorithm
to deﬁne the most frequent patterns of care. The results allow
drawing electronic temporal phenotypes which describe well-
characterized pathology classes across the studied population,
and provide the surgeons with relevant help in care delivery.
A further crucial topic for applying AI in breast cancer care, and
indeed relevant for any application of AI in healthcare, relates to
ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI), wonderfully addressed in
the paper by Carter and colleagues [23], in this special issue. This
highlights the ELSI challenges and their possible solutions and re-
inforces the importance of thinking carefully on what is to come
and addressing AI risks before implementation. This approach will
have to include all stakeholders involved to the design an effective
risk mitigation plan that will support the introduction of AI in
breast cancer care and inform its expansion in ethical and socially
acceptable pathways.
AI is here to stay, generally in healthcare, but also speciﬁcally in
breast cancer care. Structured research is needed to investigate not
only the accuracy and utility of the new AI-related processes
compared to what exists as standard of care, but also to ensure
these AI tools are transferable beyond the speciﬁc settings where
they were developed. The future could change rapidly and the
way we adapt to it will deﬁne how effectively multidisciplinarity
operates and how clinical skills work jointly with AI skills to
develop the pathway for implementing AI in clinical care for the
beneﬁt of breast cancer patients. Such a pathway must consider
an ethical construct for using AI and engage stakeholders, including
breast cancer consumers, in decisions regarding where AI is accept-
able as part of healthcare. This may enable us to build a future

where AI will be used to augment not only healthcare professionals
but also patients, to inform or complement, rather than dictate clin-
ical decisions, and to ultimately transition to an AI-supported clin-
ical pathway in breast cancer care.

Methodological issues: The idea of having a virtual joint special
issue on the advent of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) in the management
of breast cancer was launched by the publisher at the end of 2018.
The special issue would have to be joint, i.e. collecting contributions
on the same topic coming from two different journals. Indeed, each
journal, with its speciﬁc target scientists, research ﬁeld, and
research methods, would have addressed only some facets of the
topic, whereas the joint approach would have provided the reader
with a more comprehensive and holistic view of the topic. The spe-
cial issue would have to be virtual, i.e. accepted papers would be
published both separately on the different journals they were sub-
mitted to, but they would also be collected all together in the ﬁnal
volume of the special issue.
As title for the joint virtual special issue, the publisher proposed
“Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Breast Cancer Care”, and the journals
invited to contribute to the virtual special issue were Artiﬁcial Intel-
ligence in Medicine (AIM) on the computer-science and methodo-
logical side, and The Breast on the clinical and medical side. The
editors in chief of the two journals invited the four guest editors
to serve in the making of the virtual joint special issue.
The four guest editors had several meetings, where they decided
that manuscript submission would have to be by invitation, only.
Guest editors also decided that submitted manuscripts should un-
dergo the usual reviewing process every manuscript undergoes
when submitted to the respective journals. The four guest editors
worked jointly, with the help of the publisher and of the two edi-
tors in chief, and they started with the identiﬁcation of current
and major research trends in the ﬁeld, according to which invita-
tions would have been sent out. Some of the identiﬁed trends cover
issues shared by both journals, while some other identiﬁed trends
are mainly covered by only one journal.
Accordingly, the current and major research trends considered
include subtopics such as imaging and image analysis; machine
learning; decision support systems; big data analytics; natural lan-
guage processing (NLP). Moreover additional trends have been
identiﬁed as emerging: personalized medicine; business intelli-
gence; ethical, legal, and social issues.
Once the major research trends were identiﬁed, guest editors
performed a deep analysis of the corresponding state of the art in
order to identify the authors to invite for the joint special issue.
This analysis led to 31 invitations on the AIM side and 15 invitations
on The Breast side. Sixteen manuscripts were submitted on the AIM
side and 13 on The Breast side, leading ﬁnally to 9 papers published
in the AIM journal and 13 published in The Breast journal.
Declaration of competing interest
When submitted manuscripts included one of the guest editors
as co-author, submissions were managed by the other guest editor
(not author of the submission), and outside the ofﬁcial submission-
management system of the journal in order to guarantee the blind
and peer-review process. Additional details regarding the process
followed in compiling the virtual joint special issue is included as
online-only supplementary material (link xxxxx).
Acknowledgments
The construction of the current virtual special issue required
much effort from many people. The four guest editors are grateful
to: Alison Waldron, Amar Bhogals, Ashley Kieran Clift, David
Spencer, Justyna Kasprzycka, Kavitha Narayanasamy, the publishers
who launched in 2018 the idea of a joint special issue and
constantly helped in the everyday care such an idea required;
Fatima Cardoso and Carlo Combi, the editors in chief of the two
journals (The Breast and Artiﬁcial Intelligence in Medicine) who
eagerly accepted the idea; the authors, who enthusiastically
accepted the invitations, and carefully revised their manuscripts
in guidance of the suggestions and recommendations from re-
viewers and guest editors; and the anonymous reviewers, whose
valuable help set up the pillars on which this project was built.

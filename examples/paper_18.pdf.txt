The decarbonisation of residential heating systems has become increasingly important to meet the global goals of 
minimising carbon emissions and combating climate change. However, with rising energy costs, this can be a 
significant challenge for low-income households. This study presents a novel optimisation framework to aid the 
decarbonisation of residential heating in the United Kingdom by combining technology-related decision-support 
with policy decisions. The framework can recommend the optimal retrofit of low-carbon heating technologies 
and fabric improvement measures such as insulation upgrades for improving energy efficiency. Concurrently, the 
optimal financial contributions towards investment costs from grants supporting low-income households and 
social housing is determined. It also includes piecewise linearisations to capture the detailed operation of air 
source heat pumps, which are set to replace natural gas-based heating systems, and assesses the eligibility of each 
dwelling for grant funding. A large case study consisting of social housing stock in Woking, UK, has been used to 
test the framework. Three scenarios are used to assess the efficacy of existing technology and policy combina-
tions to meet local emissions reduction targets, which are benchmarked against emissions from existing gas- 
based heating systems and insulation measures. Results highlight the limitations of existing UK grants, as 
these can only achieve an emissions reduction of 33.5% without incurring significant additional investment costs 
to the local council. The lack of support towards installing hot water tanks, which are required for the operation 
of heat pumps, is another major limitation in existing grants. A proposed scenario, which introduces a fictional 
grant with unlimited funding, sheds light on the much larger grant contributions expected to achieve an emis-
sions reduction of 66.8%, which surpasses local targets. These results also suggest the need for operational 
support to cope with much higher energy bills, especially for low-income and/or fuel-poor households, due to the 
electrification of heating systems. Overall, the framework is a useful tool for local councils, policy makers, and 
other stakeholders to make informed decisions on the affordable decarbonisation of residential heating systems.   
1. Introduction 
Climate change and its effects pose an undeniable threat to natural 
ecosystems and human wellbeing. It is estimated that approximately 
14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate 
change, are a result of residential heating [1]. Addressing emissions in 
this sector will be vital if carbon neutrality by 2050, part of Goal 13 of 
the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, is to be achieved 
[2]. A 2019–20 English Housing Survey found that 86% of UK 
households use gas-fuelled central heating [3]. When coupled with 
low-carbon electricity, heat pumps form a promising alternative in a 
net-zero carbon future. Air-source heat pumps (ASHP), account for the 
majority of installations due to the low cost relative to their ground and 
water source counterparts [4]. As of 2019, heat pumps meet less than 
3% of building heating needs [5]. In the UK, the range of the gas network 
has allowed traditional heating methods to stay economically attractive 
– thereby weakening the appeal of heat pumps. Consequently, various 
government grants and schemes are in place to fund the installation of 
ASHPs, as well as the retrofitting of insulation measures [4], to

encourage their uptake. 
The integration and retrofit of low-carbon heating technologies in 
buildings, especially residential settings, have been increasingly inves-
tigated using mathematical optimisation models. These are commonly 
used to determine the designs and operational schedules of low-carbon 
and renewable heating technologies, as these can capture the large 
number of considerations and constraints relevant to various technolo-
gies, external networks, and stakeholders involved. Small-scale low- 
carbon and renewable heating technologies are increasingly studied in 
optimisation models for microgrids and Distributed Energy Systems 
(DES), which also consider technologies for meeting other energy needs, 
such as electricity and cooling. Focusing on design models, the key de-
cision variables in these models, such as the capacities of heating tech-
nologies and their locations, are influenced by operational limitations 
such as weather and demand, socio-economic factors such as policies 
and tariffs, and other technical and environmental constraints [6]. 
Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulations have been 
abundantly employed in literature to capture these considerations, and 
these have been preferred over nonlinear programming models which 
are complex to formulate and solve. In Ma et al. [7], a MILP model is 
created to find the optimal design and operational strategy of a DES, 
satisfying heat loads with a CHP or a ground source heat pump. The 
Coefficient of Performance (CoP) of the heat pump, a nonlinear tem-
perature dependent variable, is treated as a constant parameter to 
maintain linearity in the formulation. This is also done by Morvaj et al. 
for air-to-water heat pumps [8]. Beck et al. [9] also consider a 
mixed-integer linear formulation to incorporate heat pumps and thermal 
storage, but considers CoP to be a function of Carnot quality number and 
fixed temperatures. Verhelst et al. [10] demonstrate that assuming a 
constant CoP for air-to-water heat pumps predicts higher electricity 
consumption and large unrealistic power fluctuations when compared to 
more detailed representations, which also impact the design and costs 
predicted by such models. Bloess et al. [11] emphasise that constant CoP 
values overlook the dependency on temperature lift, with large differ-
ences between air source and water supply temperatures leading to re-
ductions in performance. To remedy this, piecewise linearisation 
methods [12], empirical linear [13,14] or nonlinear [15,16] formulae 
based on manufacturer datasheets may be used to simulate more real-
istic heat pump performance. 
Building energy efficiency is often a prerequisite for the retrofit of 
low-carbon heating technologies such as heat pumps, as inefficient 
buildings can exacerbate operating costs and any carbon emissions 
associated with electricity from the grid. Existing government grants 
often require additional insulation measures to be retrofitted, to increase 
the energy efficiency of the building [17]. In the U.K., the energy effi-
ciency of the building is graded within Energy Performance Certificates 
(EPC) [18]. MILP models for building insulation decisions have been 
explored extensively in literature, to determine insulation type [19,20], 
material thickness [21,22], or both [23–25]. Some studies have also 
focused on the assessment of environmental impacts through the means 
of insulation material life cycle assessment in Refs. [25–27]. Despite the 
necessity to consider the retrofit of insulation measures in combination 
with low-carbon heating, few studies have attempted this in MILP for-
mulations. These include studies that have limited insulation measures 
to just one type, with a focus on optimising insulation thickness [22,23, 
28]. In some studies [19,20,24], heating technology decisions are

limited to boiler fuel type, without considering other low-carbon heating 
technologies. These studies also do not incorporate an investment cost 
for the heating technologies, a parameter that may affect optimal insu-
lation design. The lack of low-carbon heating technology decisions made 
simultaneously alongside insulation decisions in existing optimisation 
models is a significant limitation to be addressed. 
As mentioned previously, energy policies and grants that provide 
financial support play a critical role in decarbonising and upgrading 
residential heating systems and improving heat retention, while making 
such systems and measures affordable. Many studies acknowledge the 
importance of considering energy policies and subsidies in optimisation 
frameworks [29]. However, there are few optimisation models that 
address them in detail, while encompassing low-carbon heating and 
energy decisions which these grants support. This is confirmed in an 
extensive literature review focusing on policy incorporation in micro-
grid frameworks [30]. Furthermore, much of the policies considered are 
related to the operation of technologies, as opposed to investment of 
technologies [30]. Policies associated with low-carbon electricity and 
heat generation, such as the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and 
Feed-In-Tariff (FIT) schemes applicable to operational costs, have been 
previously considered in optimisation frameworks for designing such 
systems [31–33]. Renaldi et al. [34] consider the Renewable Heat 
Incentive [35] to reduce overall design costs, while incorporating 
heating pumps with a simplistic linear regression to estimate CoP. Calise 
et al. [36] consider a 50% capital investment subsidy when designing a 
Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system for an Italian 
residential building, tested on TRNSYS [37]. While this study does not 
consider any detailed constraints for the subsidies allocation to different 
technologies, it does shed light on the importance of such subsidies to 
make investments more affordable to consumers. Zwickel-Bernhard 
et al. [38] optimise the balance between subsidy payments to the 
property owner and the tenant in retrofitting wall insulation and 
installing renewable heating solutions. These grants take the form of 
initial investment contributions to the property owner and yearly energy 
bill support for the tenant. However, this multi-period model focuses 
heavily on the grant distribution trait of the problem, simplifying insu-
lation and heating constraints. As existing studies have overlooked 
policies that support investment decisions for low-carbon heating and 
improving energy efficiency, most optimisation frameworks for 
designing low-carbon heating systems and supporting policy decisions 
related to these remain ill-suited for the purpose. 
1.1. Contributions of this study 
As illuminated previously in the literature review, there is a signifi-
cant lack of optimisation frameworks that capture the decarbonisation 
of heating systems while including the impact of subsidies and specific 
grants directly. To address this gap, this study proposes a MILP frame-
work, portrayed in Fig. 1, which encompasses low-carbon heating 
technologies, insulation measures for improving energy efficiency, and 
financial decisions influenced by policies that assist in the decarbon-
isation process. In detail, the work aims. 
• To develop an optimisation model to explore the allocation and in-
vestment decisions for low-carbon heating technologies for retrofit in 
existing social housing stock through an MILP model that includes 
air-source heat pumps, electric boilers, and different common insu-
lation options;  
• To include, for the first time in an optimisation formulation, the 
eligibility and effects of the various policy and grants available for a 
given housing stock; 
• To include heat pump performance details via a piecewise linear-
isation scheme; 
• To reveal the impacts of different policies. The approach can deter-
mine economic impacts on different stakeholders, which policies are 
effective at encouraging technology uptake in terms of carbon 
emissions and cost reductions, and support decision-making on new 
policy development;  
• To conduct a case study on Woking to test the proposed model and 
provide decision-making support on a real dataset. 
The framework determines the optimal mix of low-carbon heating 
technologies, such as electric boilers and a variety of air-to-water heat 
pumps and employs piecewise linearisations obtained from manufac-
turer datasheets to capture their operation in detail. To support these 
decisions, the optimal retrofit of common insulation measures is also 
modelled, following an eligibility assessment of the characteristics and 
EPC of buildings. A generic formulation for policies and grants that 
enable the investment of low-carbon heating and insulation measures is 
also proposed, where the eligibility and availability of each technology 
and measure under each grant is assessed in detail prior to determining 
the overall investment decisions. The framework is tested using a real- 
world case study consisting of social housing in the Borough of Wok-
ing, UK Existing government grants for social housing, some with spe-
cific constraints and requirements, are also included. The framework is 
tested under the objective of minimising total annualised costs to the 
consumer or investor, which includes overall investment and opera-
tional costs with reductions from grant contributions, as well as a 
combined objective of minimising total costs alongside operational 
carbon emissions. 
The framework can be used as a tool for evaluating the efficacy of the 
proposed decarbonisation methods and policies, as it is capable of 
evaluating and satisfying the prerequisites of policies while making 
technological decisions towards decarbonisation. Testing various new 
scenarios using the developed tool, prior to societal implementation, 
will allow decision-makers to gain further insights as to the potential 
technoeconomic performance of a proposed policy at its mathematical 
optimum. It can also be used by other stakeholders, such as local 
councils and homeowners, who wish the assess the investment of low- 
carbon heating technologies and energy efficiency improvements with 
support from existing grants. Overall, the framework and study facili-
tates the decarbonisation of existing heating systems. 
1.2. Paper overview 
The mathematical model which underpins the optimisation frame-
work proposed in this study is presented in Section 2. This section de-
scribes the constraints and equations related to cost calculations, 
heating and storage technologies, insulation measures, and policies. The 
case study used to test the framework is detailed in Section 3, which 
includes parameters and considerations associated with the housing 
stock, technologies, grants, and the various scenarios used for model 
testing. Results for each of the scenarios are presented and extensively 
discussed in Section 4. The Conclusions in Section 5 summarise the key 
outcomes of this study, and the potential for future research. 
2. Mathematical model 
The mathematical formulations used in the framework are provided 
in this Section. This includes the objective function and general elec-
tricity and heating balances provided in Section 2.1, specific equations 
for the heating technologies in Section 2.2, constraints incorporating 
insulation measures in Section 2.3, and formulations capturing policy- 
related decision making in Section 2.4.

The equations associated with each of the terms in this objective 
function are presented in the subsequent sub-sections. This objective 
function does not consider carbon emissions. An alternative multi- 
objective formulation which encompasses the impacts of carbon emis-
sions using a carbon cost CCARBON (further described by equation S(E4) –

Note that the model has been implemented such that each season s ∈
S can be solved independently, as previously presented by Ref. [39], 
where linking constraints ensure that key variables remain the same 
across each season. The capacity of each heating and storage technology 
considered in this study, indicated by HT for notational simplicity, must 
remain the same across each season for each cluster and technology:

tional simplicity.

binary variable Wi,j is used to indicate selection of insulation measures, 
while Ii,j is a parametric indicator for whether a cluster is eligible for the

A Big-M constraint is used to enforce a logical constraint, where heat 
from the boiler Hboiler
i,t,b should only be produced if the boiler b has been 
selected for the dwelling. In these constraints, M is a large value which 
acts as an upper bound while avoiding nonlinearity. In this case, M is 
assigned a value of 100 kW, large enough to exceed any reasonable 
domestic boiler output.

The boiler capacity capboiler

is chosen to ensure that the heat demand 
at each timepoint is met. The heat produced by boiler b at each time 
point cannot exceed this capacity:

(10) 
As the boiler can be either fuelled by gas or electricity, both must be 
considered when calculating the output. The fuel demands, Eboiler
i,t,b 
or 
Gboiler
i,t,b for electricity and gas, respectively, is multiplied by the respective 
efficiency ηb. The parameters ELECb ∈ {0, 1} and GASb ∈ {0, 1} are used 
to indicate the type of boiler (where ELECb = 1 if b is an electric boiler), 
such that the correct fuel type is used.

2.2.2. Heat pumps 
When a heat pump p ∈ P is installed in a dwelling, it is always 
coupled with a hot water storage tank [40]. These have subscript k ∈ K. 
Pump capacity cappump
t,p 
and Coefficient of Performance CoPt,p are based 
on nonlinear functions of the ambient temperature Tamb that are divided 
into six linear formulations through piecewise linearisation. The co-
efficients a, b, c and d vary per pump model. Performance data and the 
piecewise temperature intervals are sourced from a Mitsubishi Electric 
Renewable Heating Databook [41]. These formulations for capacities 
and CoPs are defined as Eqs. (16) and (17), respectively.

The binary variable Ai,p indicates whether pump p is in use, with (18) 
constraining the system such that only one pump can be used at each 
house. The Big-M constraint (19) ensures that linearity can be main-
tained for the logical constraint where a pump p can only provide heat to 
tank k if the pump is in use.

account Ci,g,d∈P; see Section 2.4 for further details.

2.2.3. Hot water storage tanks 
Heat into the hot water tank Hchar
i,t,k at house i at time t is equal to the 
sum of all heat pump outputs: 
Hchar
i,t,k =
∑
p
Hpump
i,t,p,k ∀i ∈ I, t ∈ T, k ∈ K
(24) 
The binary variable Zi,k indicates whether tank k ∈ K is in use, with 
(25) constraining the system such that only one tank can be used at each 
house. The Big-M constraint (26) ensures that heat from heat pumps 
Hchar
i,t,k can only flow into tank k if Zi,k = 1. 
∑
k
Zi,k ≤ 1∀i ∈ I, k ∈ K
(25)  
Hchar
i,t,k ≤ M⋅Zi,k∀i ∈ I, t ∈ T, k ∈ K
(26) 
For modelling purposes, the temperature in the tank Ti,t,k can take on 
a value of zero if the tank is not used (i.e., when Zi,k = 0). When Zi,k = 1, 
the tank temperature must be maintained above a set minimum Tmin. 
Ti,t,k ≥ Tmin⋅Zi,k∀i ∈ I, t ∈ T, k ∈ K
(27) 
The temperature in the tank is equal to the effective heat Hi,t,k (en-
ergy available for heating above room temperature Troom) plus room 
temperature, set here as 20 ◦C. Any heat within the tank below room 
temperature cannot be used to heat the room in this system without 
infringing the Second Law of Thermodynamics. As a result, Hi,t,k only 
concerns heat at temperatures above 20 ◦C. Multiplying Troom by the 
binary variable Zi,k sets the temperatures of unused tanks to 0. The 
specific heat capacity cw of water is 0.00116 kW h/kgK. Water density 
and volume of the tank are ρ and Vk, respectively. 
Ti,t,k = Hi,t,k
cwρVk
+ Troom⋅Zi,k∀i ∈ I, t ∈ T, k ∈ K
(28) 
Eq. (29) limits the temperature in the tank to the water supply 
temperature Tws
p of the heat pump (for these pumps, 55 ◦C). 
Ti,t,k ≤ Tws
p ∀i ∈ I, t ∈ T, k ∈ K
(29) 
Eqs. (30) and (31) return the effective heat Hi,t,k (heat above room 
temperature) in the hot water tank at time t, which is equal to the heat at 
(t −1) and the heat charged Hchar
i,t,k into the tank, minus the heat dis-
charged Hdisch
i,t,k to the dwelling and heat losses Hloss
k 
in kW to the sur-
roundings. In this model, it is assumed that the starting temperature of 
the tank is Tmin. Hence, the Hi,t−1,k term for (31) equals the effective heat 
at this temperature when t = 1. Including Zi,k ensures that this only 
applies to the tank k being used.

(32) 
Eq. (33) calculates the annualised investment cost ACINV,tank of the 
tanks. Note that Ci,g,d∈K represents the contribution towards the capital 
costs from grants g ∈ G, for technologies d ∈ K which represents tanks; 
see Section 2.2.3.

2.3. Insulation measures 
The average demand reduction Ri,j for each insulation measure, first 
presented in Eq. (5), is considered. The sum of percentage reductions 
from these insulation measures cannot exceed 1: 
∑
j
Wi,j⋅Ri,j⋅Ii,j ≤ 1∀i ∈ I
(34) 
The overall annualised cost of installing insulation measures 
ACINV,insul takes into account the capital cost of each measure Cins
i,j . A cost 
adjustment factor CAi is used to adjust the capital cost if the dwelling i is 
a bungalow, as the average values for Cins
i,j used are applicable to houses 
(values are provided in Appendix E). The grant contribution towards 
each insulation measure is also considered by Ci,g,j. 
ACINV,insul = CRF⋅

As the insulation measures do not have a variable for capacity, a 
linking constraint for the seasonal binary variable Wi,j,s is utilised to 
ensure that the same insulation measure is selected across seasons. 
If s > 1Wi,j,s = CapDER
i,j,s−1∀i ∈ I, j ∈ J, s ∈ S  
2.4. Policy formulation 
The set g ∈ G for policies and grants includes those contributing to 
capital costs. All heating technologies and insulation measures are now 
defined as set d ∈ D = {GB, EB, P, J} (see Section 3.3 for the specific 
grants considered). 
A parametric indicator Igr
i,g,d ∈ {0, 1} is used for all eligible heating 
technologies and insulation measures to represent whether cluster i is 
eligible for measure d under grant g as a primary measure. Each dwelling 
also has to be assessed for its eligibility, based on characteristics such as 
EPC band. This is indicated by another parameter Ied
i,g ∈ {0, 1}. Binary 
variable Yi,g,d indicates whether the grant g has been used for cluster i 
and measure d. If a cluster does not have an eligible primary measure for 
grant g, then the binary variable must be zero: 
Yi,g,d ≤ Igr
g,d⋅Ied
i,g∀i ∈ I, d ∈ D, g ∈ G
(36) 
A second parametric indicator Isec
g,d is used to indicate whether a 
measure is eligible as a secondary measure. Secondary measures can 
only be installed if a primary measure, such as insulation, has been 
installed, as in (37). If no insulation measures can be installed, this 
constraint can be neglected for i. This applies to any policy where only 
one primary measure must be chosen before a secondary measure can be 
installed, for each cluster and each policy. The eligibility of primary and 
secondary insulation measures is defined by Ii,j.

∑

Note that Yi,g,d∈J can only be 1 if insulation measure j is eligible for 
installation at dwelling i, as indicated by the insulation parameter Ii,j. 
∑
g
Yi,g,d∈J ≤ Ii,j∀i ∈ I, d ∈ D, g ∈ G
(38) 
The nonnegative grant contribution towards the capital cost of a 
technology or measure Ci,g,d can only take a value greater than zero if the 
binary variable takes the value 1. This is presented as a big-M constraint. 
Ci,g,d ≤ M⋅Yi,g,d∀i ∈ I, d ∈ D, g ∈ G
(39) 
Parameter CCg represents the maximum contribution offered by the 
grant for eligible measures for each household. The total grant contri-
bution for each dwelling has to be less than or equal to this maximum 
cost reduction. 
∑
d∈D
Ci,g,d ≤ CCg∀i ∈ I, g ∈ G
(40) 
Similar to the maximum grant contribution imposed on each 
household, there is also a maximum grant contribution available to the 
region or local area assessed, CCT
g. Therefore, the summation of the grant 
contributions for this local area, accounting for the total number of 
houses in each cluster Nhouses
i
, cannot exceed CCT
g. 
∑
i∈I,d∈D
Ci,g,d⋅Nhouses

(41) 
The total grant contribution for each technology d must be less than 
or equal to the capital cost incurred by the technology d. Eq. (42) rep-
resents this for insulation, where the insulation capital cost Cins
i,j , cost 
adjustment factor for bungalows CAi, and the binary variable Wi,j indi-
cating the selection of the measure, are all utilised. Eq. (43) represents 
this for ASHPs, where the total grant contribution is restricted by the 
binary selection Ai,p, capital cost of each pump CCpump
p
, and installation 
cost ICpump. Eq. (44) constrains total grant contribution for boilers, where 
only gas boilers are considered (using the parameter GASb) as existing 
grants do not fund electric boilers. The boiler binary selection Bi,b, 
capital cost CCboiler
b
, and installation cost ICboiler is also included. The 
grant contribution for tanks are also considered, as shown in Eq. (45), 
with respect to its binary selection and capital cost.

The equations above outline all the policy constraints introduced 
into the model formulation. Additionally, a discounted VAT of 5% is 
applied to the to the capital expenses of all insulation measures as a pre- 
optimisation calculation [42].

3. Case study 
3.1. Housing stock 
The case study tested is a stock of 1658 dwellings in the borough of 
Woking, Surrey, England. The majority of grants only apply to low- 
income households, and thus the social housing sector was chosen. For 
such dwellings, retrofit investment costs are incurred by the housing 
association, Woking Borough Council, and utility bills are paid by the 
household residents. 
Information on dwelling type (e.g., house), dwelling type detail (e.g., 
detached) and Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) score was provided 
by the Council. To reduce computational complexity, the dwellings were 
clustered such that each cluster represented a type, type detail and EPC 
band. Large groups, such as flats with EPC C, were further divided 
further. The 39 resultant clusters are displayed in Appendix C: Dwelling 
clusters. 
Energy demands for these clusters were determined using the Cam-
bridge Housing Model (CHM). This model uses data from the 2011 En-
glish Housing Survey to estimate emissions and energy use for 22 million 
dwellings in England and Scotland. The dwellings are sorted into 14,951 
housing codes by region, tenure type, EPC rating and more than 100 
further building physics parameters [44]. Monthly energy demands for 
the housing codes most representative of the clusters were aggregated 
into four seasons. Dividing by the number of days resulted in a repre-
sentative day for each season and housing cluster. Hourly energy con-
sumption behaviour is based on data from Morvaj et al. [45]. The CHM is 
also used to determine baseline emissions CO2eannual
baseline, against which 
emissions reduction will be determined. A Surrey County target reduc-
tion of 61% by 2035 will be considered in the new scenarios and designs 
[46], indicated by CO2eannual
new
, which is described below in Eq. (47). 
CO2eannual
baseline − CO2eannual
new
CO2eannual
baseline
≤ 0.61
(47) 
Consequently, a projected reduced carbon intensity of the electrical 
grid in 2035, taken as 15 gCO2e/kWh, as predicted in the Sixth Carbon 
Budget [47]. 
3.2. Design options 
Six boilers and three ASHPs are considered as heating technology 
options, as presented in Table 1 and Table 2, respectively. Note that the 
overall system lifetime is considered to be 20 years, i.e., all installed 
technologies are assumed to be operational for a total period of 20 years. 
The coefficients used in the piecewise linearisation for cappump
t,p 
and 
CoPpump
t,p 
are presented in Appendix F: ASHP coefficients. The capacity 
listed by Mitsubishi Electric is included in Table 2 [48]. To use an ASHP 
as a heating source, a hot water storage tank must also be installed, the 
options for which are presented in Table 3. 
Optionally, the clusters are allowed to retrofit the insulation mea-
sures listed in Table 4. The average space heating demand reduction RI,j 
is determined using the CHM. The eligibility of a cluster to install an 
insulation form is dependent on the wall, loft and window characteris-
tics defined in the CHM. Loft insulation is considered to be retrofitted to 
300 mm. As the existing loft insulation at the clusters vary in thickness, 
the effect of retrofitting is strongly cluster dependent. Hence, the Ri,loft 
differs per cluster – as defined in Appendix G: Loft insulation perfor-
mance. Costs are sourced from Ref. [49] and, where applicable, a VAT 
discount [50] has been applied. The number of eligible insulation 
measures available for the total case study (1658 dwellings) is outlined 
in Table 5. 
3.3. Grants and scenarios 
The existing applicable grants are presented in Table 6. As Green 
Jump Surrey is a county addition to the Green Homes Grant, the two are 
combined into one grant, as in Table 7. Budget limitations for the Social 
Housing Decarbonisation Fund differ based on the dwelling’s EPC rat-
ing. Hence, the fund is divided into the individual grants. This fund also 
has its own unique set of constraints (SE1 – SE3), outlined in Appendix 
A: SHDF specific constraints. Note that no grants apply to homes rated 
EPC A, B or C. Relevant assumptions for Table 7 are discussed in Ap-
pendix D: Policy assumptions. Primary and secondary measures are re-
flected by a ‘P’ and ‘S’, respectively. The limits CCT
GHG GJS, CCT
PROP and 
CCPROP are set to a value sufficiently high for the grant to effectively be 
unlimited. 
Three scenarios are constructed based on these grants. The No Grant 
scenario omits any form of government contributions. The Business-as- 
Usual, or BAU, scenario includes the grants currently applicable to 
Woking Borough. These include GHG-GJS, ECO and SHDF. The Proposed 
scenario additionally includes the PROP grant, an unlimited grant that 
also funds hot water tanks – a key investment overlooked by existing 
strategy. Their emissions and annual energy bills are compared to a 
baseline defined by the case study’s existing heating installations, as per 
the Cambridge Housing Model. These installations consist of electric 
boilers and gas boilers with efficiencies often lower than state-of-the-art 
options. 
4. Results and discussion 
4.1. No carbon tax 
This section discusses the results of the optimal design, utilising Eq. 
(1) as the objective function without carbon costs, under the three sce-
narios. Additionally, Surrey’s emissions target is tested by constraining 
the system to achieve an ER of at least 61% by 2035. The total 
annualised costs and associated carbon emissions reductions are pre-
sented in Table 8. Under the Proposed scenario, an ER of 66.8% is ach-
ieved, regardless of the 61% constraint. This is due to the availability of 
sufficient funding from the grants that enable the retrofit all EPC D/E/F 
dwellings with air-source heat pumps and insulation measures, 
decreasing carbon emissions beyond the 61% ER target.

various scenarios with no ER constraint. No Grant results indicate that, 
for loft and cavity wall insulation, operating expenditure (OPEX) savings 
from retrofitting can outweigh its capital expenditure (CAPEX) over the 
course of the assumed 20-year timeline. All 257 eligible dwellings install 
cavity wall insulation, with 319 of 330 eligible energy inefficient 
households also retrofitting loft insulation. However, despite 434 EPC 
A/B/C dwellings being eligible for loft insulation, the model predicts 
that only 5 benefit financially from installing such measure. This is likely 
due to the demand reduction factor Ri,j being lower for these house-
holds, as can be expected for these relatively energy efficient homes. 
Section 3.2 states that solid wall insulation can reduce space heating 
demand significantly. However, with high investment costs starting at 
£2188, no dwellings are able to achieve sufficient OPEX savings for it to 
be financially advantageous within 20 years. In the BAU scenario, 
however, the SHDF grant provides sufficient funding for 100 of 250 
eligible households to install solid wall insulation. Due to double glazing 
having the highest upfront cost and the lowest Ri,j value, none of the 90 
eligible dwellings install this measure under the No Grant and BAU 
scenarios. It is only retrofitted under the Proposed scenario, where the 
unlimited PROP budget is able to fully fund any insulation for homes 
with EPC D/E/F. Note that homes with EPC A/B/C are not eligible for 
any grants, and hence demonstrate no change across scenarios. 
After the model is constrained such that carbon emissions must be 
reduced by 61% from baseline values, the trends identified in Fig. 2a do 
not apply. In the No Grant scenario, a significant increase in retrofitting 
the dwellings in the A/B/C group occurs, with an additional 268 
dwellings installing loft insulation. Furthermore, 150 EPC D/E/F 
dwellings install the financially unattractive solid wall insulation to 
achieve Surrey’s ER target. Under BAU, grants are available to EPC D/E/ 
F households. As a result, an additional 100 solid wall insulation mea-
sures are installed and the focus is shifted towards improving the energy 
performance of the fuel poor dwellings. This trend continues under the 
Proposed scenario, where the additional PROP grant provides further 
funding. The costs to Woking Borough Council associated with these 
retrofits are outlined in Table 9. Naturally, there are operational cost 
savings associated with retrofitting insulation measures. These are dis-
cussed in Section 4.1.3. 
4.1.2. Heating 
As demonstrated by the No Grant results in Fig. 3a, heat pumps are 
not currently an economically attractive form of domestic heating 
without financial assistance towards their costs. The high investment 
costs of the ASHPs and accompanying hot water storage tanks result in a 
CAPEX significantly larger than that of gas boilers. Under BAU, funding 
is available to promote the installation of ASHPs. Storage tanks, costing 
at least £1510, remain unfunded, and therefore is a cost incurred to the 
consumer or council.

For the case study timeline, average predicted unit costs for elec-
tricity and gas are 23.1 and 4.7 p/kWh, respectively [58-60] (see Ap-
pendix E: Scalars). The OPEX savings from a gas boiler eventually 
outweigh the higher CAPEX costs, leading to ASHPs being unfavourable 
for all but one housing cluster: C10 (see Appendix C for all cluster 
codes). This single-household cluster has an EPC of E, and is therefore 
also able to fully fund the installation of an ASHP under the SHDF with 
£10,771 – a value for which other households are ineligible. Under the 
Proposed scenario, the PROP grant is formulated such that it covers the 
capital costs of the hot water tanks as well as the heat pumps reducing 
investment costs for the overall ASHP system by at least £1510. This 
leads to renewable heating becoming competitive with non-funded gas 
boilers. Electric boilers do not present themselves as the optimal heating 
source in any scenarios due to their inefficiency compared to an ASHP’s 
CoP. These results suggest that financial assistance in the form of grants 
could play a decisive role in installing more residential heat pumps, 
especially to support the UK Government’s goal of installing 600,000 
heat pumps by 2028 [54]. 
The results presented in. 
Fig. 3b reflect the heating technologies installed to achieve Surrey’s 
2035 emissions reduction target. Though gas boilers remain the most 
prevalent domestic heating source, retrofitting ASHPs is crucial to 
decreasing emissions by 61% from baseline values. The investment costs 
associated with the heat pump uptake levels are outlined in Table 10. 
4.1.3. Grant contributions 
The increase in costs discussed in the previous section highlights the 
financial barriers associated with adopting low carbon heating and the 
importance of an effective decarbonisation strategy. In order to reduce 
carbon emissions, it is vital grants are constructed such that the mea-
sures capable of achieving the highest emission reductions are priori-
tised. All of the grants in this case study, with the exception of GHG-GJS, 
employ a ‘fabric first’ approach – implying eligible insulation measures 
must be installed before ASHPs are funded. This promotes the 
improvement of home energy efficiency, thereby helping to reduce 
operating costs and thermal discomfort within the homes. A fabric first 
approach also promotes the reduction of heating demand prior to 
installing new heating technologies, thereby avoiding the installation of 
unnecessarily large heating system. However, BAU results in Table 11 
indicate that, in order to achieve decarbonisation targets, the optimal 
distribution of grants shifts from funding insulation measures to funding 
ASHPs. It must be noted that these results are specific to this case study 
and its grant structures and cannot be considered all-encompassing. 
‘Fabric first’ constraints are not broken here as insulation measures 
are installed at the relevant households, though not funded by external 
grants. Additionally funding these measures would lead to grant budgets 
being exceeded. 
Similarly, Table 12 breaks down the grant contributions under the 
Proposed scenario – which achieves an emissions reduction of 66.8 
without any emissions target enforced. No limit is set on the PROP grant, 
and thus no compromises have to be made in terms of budget allocation. 
This allows for much larger contributions towards minimising emis-
sions, especially towards costly ASHP investments, reducing the finan-
cial burden placed on the Council to fund such measures. 
4.1.4. Energy bills 
Fuel poverty is linked to a household’s disposable income after en-
ergy bills have been paid. Hence, decreasing this household energy bill is 
key. Fig. 4 outlines the average energy bill for those living in EPC D/E/F

homes under the various scenarios. Due to its high unit cost relative to 
natural gas, electricity consumption dominates the annual expenditure. 
This is particularly evident when the system is constrained to reducing 
baseline carbon emissions by 61%. This constraint promotes the use of 
ASHPs, an electrified form of heating. Though this heating method 
boasts a higher energy efficiency than boilers, the significant difference 
in costs between gas and electricity leads to higher total energy bills – 
despite the additional insulation. Under the Proposed scenario, the 
households have unlimited funding to install insulation measures that 
help reduce the overall energy demand, and consequently, electricity 
consumption costs. However, the annual energy bill remains 4.7% 
higher than the baseline value. This implies that, without OPEX support 
and under current tariffs, the decarbonisation of heating will lead to 
higher annual energy bills and can potentially exacerbate fuel poverty. 
4.2. Including carbon tax 
The following section presents results for the multi-objective opti-
misation model, where Eq. (2) is used as the objective function. Itera-
tively increasing the weighting of this carbon tax Ctax produces results 
that reflect the system design at various degrees of decarbonisation. For 
all scenarios, the first set of results has a Ctax value of zero, mirroring the 
results discussed in Section 4. With a projected grid carbon intensity of 
0.015 kgCO2e/kWh, the maximum achievable emission reduction from 
baseline values is 96.7%. 
In all cases, a trade-off can be seen between retrofitting insulation 
measures and ASHPs. The former is cheaper, but has a significantly 
smaller impact on decarbonisation performance of the system. Under the 
No Grant scenario, increasing insulation from 581 to 1234 installations 
results in a minor increase in emission reductions – reflected by the 
change from 31.3% to 37.5% in Fig. 5a. As weighting on carbon emis-
sions increases, the system is driven to decarbonise further by installing 
ASHPs, which have a greater impact on driving down carbon emissions 
when compared to insulation measures. This results in a compromise 
between insulation measures and ASHPs, where insulation investment is 
reduced to facilitate increased ASHP installation, especially in instances 
where the tax is not sufficiently high for the simultaneous increase in 
insulation investment and ASHP installation to be cost-effective. The 
additional ASHPs allow the system to increase emissions reduction from 
37.5% to 51.5%. Another notable trend from Fig. 5 is the phasing out of 
gas boilers. Under all scenarios, the system achieves an ER of more than 
90% without fully phasing out gas boilers. This is likely due to the gas 
boiler options presented in Table 1 boasting high thermal efficiencies 
(reflecting technological improvements as seen in reality), relative to 
existing installations. As the carbon tax weighting increases significantly 
more than other costs, these final boilers are replaced by their electric 
counterparts due to their relatively low investment cost, relative to 
ASHPs. The dwellings at which these are installed are those with the 
lowest heating demand. For these households, the operational savings 
from an ASHP do not outweigh the high associated investment costs. 
This implies that electric boilers may be a promising solution to the 
decarbonisation of small homes – provided they are powered by low- 
carbon electricity. If the source of electricity is not fully carbon 
neutral, however, then the efficient nature of ASHPs leads to them being

the sole solution in this case study to minimising carbon emissions, as 
reflected by the results for ER = 96.7% in all scenarios. 
4.3. Model limitations 
The modelling framework proposed in this study tests the efficacy of 
residential heating and energy efficiency grants. In the case study tested, 
the Proposed scenario was used to highlight the importance of funding 
hot water storage tanks and the budget limitations of the current grant 
structure. In reality, such budget limitations are set due to the larger 
macroeconomic effects local authorities and governments may suffer. 
This modelling framework is unable to analyse such effects. The model 
also assumes that all installations are made in the beginning of the 
modelling period considered, and is unable to recommend the optimal 
year of installation. Such a model would require predictions on future 
grants and budgets, changes to technology measures such as declining 
costs and increased efficiencies, and potential changes to demand pro-
files. Furthermore, the thermal comfort and health benefits associated 
with improved quality of housing through insulation upgrades are not 
considered. Future work could include government expenditure and its 
contributions from different sources within the objective function and 
modelling framework, which would capture a more optimal scenario for 
both the private and public sectors. 
5. Conclusions 
This study aims to address the lack of optimisation frameworks to 
support decision-making in decarbonising residential heating systems. It 
does so by developing an MILP framework which captures key design, 
operational, and financial decision variables for low-carbon heat gen-
eration and storage, insulation measures to reduce energy demand, and 
requirements and contributions from policies associated with the former 
two. Additionally, the nonlinear nature of a heat pump’s performance is 
represented through piecewise linearisation. Detailed policy re-
quirements are integrated using generic formulations that can be 
applied to a range of capital investment grants. Consequently, the 
framework can be applied to a variety of case studies to aid stakeholders 
in their policy decision making process. 
For this study, housing stock and policies specific to Woking Borough 
Council are used as a test case. Three scenarios are tested alongside 
Surrey County’s carbon emission reduction target to examine the effi-
cacy of the grants in place. The framework is used to quantitatively 
assess how effective various policy and technology combinations are in 
achieving practical objectives such as lowering operational costs or 
maximising carbon emissions reductions. Results for this case study 
illuminate that.  
1. Utilising the existing grant structure contributes to 31.3% emission 
reduction, which does not meet the Council’s target reduction of 
61% by 2035.  
2. A nearly 30-fold increase in investment on low-carbon technologies 
is required to achieve the 61% target.  
3. The maximum emission reduction that can be achieved with current 
low-carbon heating technology (with an unlimited grant) at the 
projected carbon intensity of the electrical grid is 96.7%.  
4. Capital investment in insulation measures can be outweighed by 
operational cost savings, i.e., the reduction in energy bills.  
5. Without operational incentives, the electrification of heating would 
lead to an increase in utility costs incurred by the consumer, which 
could exacerbate fuel poverty. 
Thus, the framework provides invaluable information to support 
decision-making, such as the limits of the system, feasible technological 
options, and policy contributions required to achieve decarbonisation 
targets. 
Further research would benefit from setting realistic grant budgets 
under the Proposed scenario. Also, grant contribution data from Table 8 
can be used to reformulate existing grants from BAU in a separate sce-
nario. For this case study, the optimal grant allocation is shifted from 
retrofitting insulation measures to ASHPs, when Surrey’s 61% emissions 
reduction target constraint is imposed. Hence, the ‘fabric first’ constraint 
of installing insulation before ASHPs could be removed to test the effects 
of this approach. Finally, rather than creating the additional grant, a 
scenario where existing grants also fund hot water storage tanks could 
be tested. Nevertheless, this work provides a flexible foundation upon 
which further case studies can developed, allowing policy makers to 
make informed decisions in decarbonisation strategy of the housing 
stock.”

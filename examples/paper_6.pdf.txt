Abstract. In this paper, we propose a new possible connection between dark matter relic
density and baryon asymmetry of the universe. The portal between standard model sector
and dark matter not only controls the relic density and detections of dark matter, but also
allows the dark matter to trigger the ﬁrst order electroweak phase transition. We discuss
systematically possible scalar dark matter candidates, starting from a real singlet to arbitrary
high representations. We show that the simplest realization is provided by a doublet, and
that strong ﬁrst-order electroweak phase transition implies a lower bound on the dark matter
direct detection rate. The mass of dark matter lies between 45 and 80 GeV, allowing for an
appreciable invisible decay width of the Standard Model Higgs boson, which is constrained
to be lighter than 130 GeV for the sake of the strong phase transition.

Introduction
The existence of dark matter (DM) has now been well established in astrophysical and cos-
mological observations, and it is known to constitute around twenty percent of the total
energy density in the universe. Many experiments have been setup underground or in the
sky in order to probe DM interactions.
The most popular DM candidate is a stable weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) [1].
The correct thermal relic density is obtained if its mass lies near the electroweak scale, thus
possible connections to electroweak symmetry breaking could be conjectured. Another pos-
sibility is the asymmetric dark matter [2] whose origin can be related to the baryogenesis
processes in the universe. This scenario has been revived recently in diﬀerent incarnations [3],
due to the observation that DM and baryon relic densities are of the same order of magni-
tude, and also partly inspired by the hints of a light GeV scale DM from direct detection
experiments. One of the common features of the above listed work is, they all resort to
baryon/lepton number violations beyond the SM. However, baryon number is known not to
be exact in the SM [4] and it is possible to have baryon number violating process happening
eﬃciently at a high temperature [5, 6] if the minimal Higgs sector is extended.
In this work, we propose a scenario, where the portal between the standard model (SM)
and dark sectors not only gives correct relic density and facilitates direct/indirect detections
of DM, but also allows the DM to play an important role in the electroweak baryogenesis.
Based on this picture, a new connection could be built between symmetric dark matter and
asymmetric baryonic matter.
An essential ingredient for successful electroweak baryogenesis is the existence of a strong
enough ﬁrst order phase transition. The ﬁnite temperature Higgs potential should contain a
term proportional to φ3T. Such a term exists in the SM but is not large enough. If the DM
were to do the job, it would have to be a scalar particle. Namely, fermions never contribute
– 1 –
JCAP02(2012)029
to the cubic term at one loop level. The question then is which scalar representation to take.
As shown below, representations with integer weak isospin cannot work. In contrast, the
half-integer representations are perfectly capable of playing this role. We will opt for the
most natural possibility of isospin one-half and leave a systematic study of higher multiplets
for a future study.
We focus on a realization of such picture where the DM is identiﬁed as an inert doublet
scalar [7]. This possibility has been extensively pursued in recent years, and moreover, it
follows naturally [8, 9] in the case of mirror families [10–13], the old dream of parity restoration
of Lee and Yang [14]. On the other hand, the extra Higgs doublet has also been amply used
as a simple way of achieving ﬁrst-order electroweak phase transition [15].
We show here that both of the above can be achieved simultaneously. This implies a
lower bound on the DM direct detection rate, an exciting result in view of the upper limit
from the Xenon experiment. Moreover, the masses of the charged and the pseudo-scalar
component of the inert scalar doublet are constrained to be almost the same and lie in a
rough window 250−350 GeV, while the DM mass is small, between 45−80 GeV. The SM
Higgs boson mass is constrained to be lighter than 130 GeV, which still allows for a large
invisible decay width. These are the main results of our paper.
There is also the need of having enough CP violation for the baryon asymmetry, which
is an independent question and will be commented on in the outlook. In any case, the study
of the phase transition is an important issue in itself.
2
The inert doublet model
The existence of another scalar doublet is one of the most natural possibilities in the SM.
Once introduced, it is natural to ask it to be the DM candidate [7].
The price is quite
high, for many couplings, including the new Yukawas, must be exceedingly tiny in order to
guarantee suﬃcient stability of the DM. It is technically natural though, due to a discrete
Z2 symmetry that protects these couplings to remain small. One should keep in mind that
the symmetry need not be exact since decaying DM is a viable possibility. For the sake of
simplicity, we ignore the possible tiny breaking of Z2, since it does not aﬀect our discussion.
With the exact Z2 symmetry Φ → Φ, D → −D, the Higgs potential takes a simple form
V0 = −µ2
Φ|Φ|2 + µ2
D|D|2 + λΦ|Φ|4 + λD|D|4 + λ3|Φ|2|D|2 + λ4|Φ†D|2 + λ5

(Φ†D)2 + h.c.

(2.1)
where Φ stands for the usual Higgs doublet and D is the inert doublet, whose lightest com-
ponent (assumed neutral) is to be identiﬁed as the DM.
Throughout the paper, we focus on the parameter space where D does not acquire a
vacuum expectation value (vev). The electroweak gauge symmetry is broken by the usual
Higgs doublet Φ only [16], which preserves the above Z2 symmetry. At zero temperature,
the mass spectra of components in the inert doublet are

S = µ2

2 v2,
m2
A = µ2
D+ λA
2 v2,

C = µ2
D+ λC

(2.2)
Here, we deﬁne λS = λ3 + λ4 + λ5, λA = λ3 + λ4 − λ5 and λC = λ3. We choose S to be the
DM candidate, which implies λ5 < 0, λ4 + λ5 < 0.

2.1
Electroweak precision tests
Since the scalar contribution to the S parameter is small, the crucial rule is played by the T
parameter, which gets a correction due to the inert doublet [7]
∆T ≈
1
24π2αv2 (mC − mA)(mC − mS) .
(2.3)
The SM itself, as is well known, prefers a light Higgs boson. In [7], the Higgs was taken
to be heavy in order to improve naturalness, which then required substantial ∆T or a non-
degenerate spectrum of the inert doublet states.
On the other hand, we are motivated by the ﬁrst-order phase transition, which favors
as light SM Higgs as possible, which in turn implies ∆T ≈ 0. There are two possibilities to
achieve this: a) mS < mC ≈ mA or b) mS ≈ mC < mA. It will turn out that S, as the DM,
has to be lighter than about 80 GeV. It is not completely clear whether the possibility b)
is in accord with the experiment [17]. For this reason, in the bulk of this letter we pursue
possibility a), where A and C are quite degenerate [18] or equivalently λ4 ≈ λ5.
2.2
Scalar doublet as dark matter
We consider S as a thermal DM candidate, as in the conventional WIMP picture.
The
main processes governing the freeze out include annihilation into gauge bosons W, Z and to
fermions via the Higgs boson exchange. It has been shown in [18] that the WMAP already
puts strong constraints on the viable parameter space. The spin-independent direct detection
cross section is [7, 19]

Tq
≡ ⟨N|mq¯qq|N⟩ is the nucleon sigma
term for light ﬂavors. In order to be conservative, we have used the lowest values from a
recent lattice calculation [20]. We assume the other components A and C are much heavier
than S, which as we show below, is the case when the phase transition constraint is taken
into account. In this case, their roles in thermal freeze out and direct detection are safely
negligible.
The combined limit from both relic density and direct detection experiments demands
the DM mass to lie approximately between 45−80 GeV [8]. This result is shown in ﬁgure 1
for the SM Higgs mass equal to 120 GeV. In the above favored DM mass window, Xenon 100
has also put tight constraint on the interaction between DM and the Higgs boson,
λS ≲ 0.1 .
(2.5)
A useful constraint follows from the above results. The mass spectrum in eq. (2.2) leads to
λ3 ≈ −2λ4 ≈ −2λ5, when mA ≈ mC ≫ mS, up to corrections of order 10 %. Demanding
the SM Higgs boson to remain light up to a few hundred GeV energy scale, i.e., ∆λΦ ∼
(3λ3/2) log(µ/mh) ≲ λΦ sets a relevant upper bound on the couplings between the two
scalar doublets. In particular, we ﬁnd λC ≡ λ3 ≲ 4. Therefore,
mA ≈ mC ≲ 350 GeV .

limit on the direct detection cross section from Xenon100 experiment is shown by the black solid line.
Also shown in the ﬁgure are the dashed curves for constant |λS|.
The mono-chromatic gamma ray line from DM annihilation in the galaxy could also serve as
a promising indirect detection of DM. In this model, the ﬂux is predicted [8] to lie only a
factor of 4−5 below the current Fermi-LAT limit.
Furthermore, since the DM mass is constrained to lie in a narrow window, eq. (2.5) also
implies µ2
D ≳ 0. Therefore, one does not have to worry about the second doublet picking up
a VEV in electroweak symmetry breaking. The phase transition involves only the evolution
of ﬁeld φ from the ﬁrst doublet Φ, while the second doublet D aﬀects the eﬀective potential
through propagating in the loops, as discussed below.

t and b = 6λD + 2λ3 + λ4 + (9g2 + 3g′2)/4.
The criterion for having a strong ﬁrst-order electroweak phase transition is vc/Tc ≳ 1
at the critical point, which calls for a large cubic thermal potential φ3T. In the inert doublet
model the new scalars are expected to play this crucial role with a suﬃciently large coupling
to the SM Higgs boson, λi ∼ O(1). In the previous section, we showed that direct detection
implies λS ≲ 0.1. Therefore, only large λA and λC could do the job, which implies that the
corresponding pseudo scalar and charged components are heavy at zero temperature.
The second crucial point to note is that the φ-independent term in the thermal masses
of A and C should be small enough in order not to dilute their contribution to the cubic
term. Namely, the optimal situation is realized when the terms in the bracket of eq. (2.8)

are minimized at the critical temperature. For a given mass spectrum this means that there
is a window for µ2
D where the phase transition could be strongly ﬁrst order. Since S shares
the same µ2
D contribution to the mass as its heavier partners, i.e., µ2
D = m2
S − λSv2/2, it in
turn predicts a lower bound on the DM direct detection rate, as shown in ﬁgure 2. This is an
important result in view of the upper bound set by Xenon 100, which constrains the masses
of A and C to lie in a window between 250−350 GeV.
– 5 –
JCAP02(2012)029
This mass window of heavy scalar masses can be probed by the LHC. In particular,
the pseudo-scalar component A can be produced in association with the DM S, and leads to
dilepton ﬁnal state with missing energy. Here, the preferred mass diﬀerence between A and
S is larger than the sample values studied in [25], which makes it easier to be distinguished
from the SM background by imposing a harder cut on the missing energy.
2.4
Implications for the SM Higgs
In ﬁgure 3, we show the dependence of critical temperature and the Higgs vev on the DM
self coupling λD and the SM Higgs mass. It turns out that the increase of either the DM self-
interaction or the SM Higgs mass reduces vc and increase Tc, and thus weaken the strength
of the phase transition. In particular, Tc increases very quickly with the Higgs mass and we
ﬁnd an upper bound on the Higgs boson mass1
mh ≲ 130 GeV .
(2.10)
In short, the scalar doublet DM can trigger the strong electroweak phase transition, as long
as it is light, below 80 GeV or so, and its partners end up being heavier.
The contribution of the charged scalar C aﬀects the branching ratio of the Higgs boson
decay into two photons, by reducing it at most by a factor of four.
2.5
What about uncertainties?
So far, we have worked in the improved one-loop approximation for the eﬀective potential at
non-zero temperature, and so one can question its reliability at higher orders in perturbation
theory. In the examples studied up to now, such as MSSM, it turns out the two-loop ef-
fects [26] only help to strengthen the phase transition. Similarly, the non-perturbative lattice
simulations tend to do the same over the perturbative results [27].
Another uncertainty lies in the possibly eﬀect of the magnetic ﬁeld during the phase
transition [5]. The size of the magnetic ﬁeld has been up to now only roughly estimated [28],
thus its eﬀect is not completely clear. It was argued recently [29] though, in the context of
the MSSM, that it may have an impact on the upper limit of the Higgs mass.
The issue of gauge invariance has been brought up [30]. It is claimed that one may again
need a complete two-loop ﬁnite-temperature eﬀective potential for this purpose. However, in
our case, the strength of the phase transition is governed by the second scalar doublet rather
than the gauge bosons. Therefore, this issue becomes less important.
3
Why not a singlet?
Before turning to higher representations, let us discuss explicitly the case of the singlet DM.
After all, this is a simpler possibility with fewer couplings and thus more constrained. In
fact, it fails to do the job. More precisely, while the singlet by itself can actually help the
phase transition to be of the ﬁrst order [31], it cannot simultaneously be the DM [32, 33],
and vice versa.
What happens is the following. In this case, there is only one coupling with the Higgs
and λA ≡ λC ≡ λS. We survey all the points in ﬁgure 2 and ﬁnd they all satisfy λA,C ≳ 1.
1In this model the mass of dark matter lies in a window that could open appreciable invisible decay channel
of the Higgs, controlled by the DM-Higgs coupling λS. Therefore, the Higgs branching ratios can deviate from
SM prediction.

Figure 3. Shape of the Higgs potential at the critical temperature and its dependence on diﬀerent
choices of parameters: DM self-interaction λD (left panel) and SM Higgs boson mass mh (right panel).
While varying λD, we have ﬁxed mh = 120 GeV, mS = 60 GeV, mA = mC = 300 GeV and while
varying mh, we have ﬁxed λD = 0, mS = 76 GeV, mA = mC = 300 GeV, respectively.
On the other hand, direct detection, as shown in eq. (2.5), constrains this coupling to be
much smaller than what is needed to trigger a strong ﬁrst-order phase transition. The failure
of the real singlet thus makes the choice of the inert doublet scalar the simplest one.
One can further extend the real scalar singlet case to a complex one. It was shown [34]
that the double job of dark matter and strong electroweak phase transition can be achieved
in this case.
On the other hand, the scalar singlet could be the carrier of the force between the SM
sector and the dark matter one [35], instead of being DM itself. Such a singlet can actually
trigger [35] the ﬁrst order phase transition. This can be successfully embedded [36] in the
NMSSM.
4
Higher representation alternative?
It could be appealing to resort to higher SU(2)L representations for DM candidate, since
then there are fewer Z2 odd couplings which destabilize them.
Let us start with integer isospin representations ∆. In order to have a neutral particle,
needed for the DM, they must have even hypercharge. Therefore, they only have two gauge
invariant terms with the SM Higgs, out of which only one can split their masses
�
∆†T a∆
� �
Φ†σaΦ
�
,
(4.1)
where T a are the appropriate generators of ∆. In the case of the real multiplet with Y = 0, the
spectrum is degenerate, while in the case of the complex one, the mass splits are proportional
to the electromagnetic charge once the Higgs gets the vev.
The former case works only for a heavy DM, above TeV, due to strong co-annihilating
eﬀects on the relic density [37]. This makes it too heavy to have an impact on the phase
transition. The latter case implies degenerate real and imaginary components of the neutral
particle, which couple to the Z. Direct detection limits can be evaded again with a TeV scale
DM. In short, as remarked in the Introduction, the integer isospin candidates fail to render
the phase transition be ﬁrst order.

where we ignore for simplicity the SU(2) conjugation. In general, this term splits the real and
imaginary neutral components and in principle allows for light DM and heavy enough other
states, just as in the case of the doublet discussed above. We will return to this intriguing
possibility in a future publication [38].
5
Outlook: what about genesis?
Before closing let us comment on a few related issues.
5.1
Sources of CP violation
Successful baryogenesis requires CP violation, not only the ﬁrst order phase transition. How-
ever, in the inert doublet case, there are no new sources of CP violation beyond the usual
Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) one [39]. If the Z2 symmetry is relaxed in order to
accommodate additional CP phases, as is the case in the usual two Higgs doublet model [40],
one loses the DM candidate.
It is easy to imagine new sources of CP violation, but the problem then arises as to
whether the new physics behind it aﬀects the nature of the phase transition. In this sense, new
fermions are more welcome, at least in the perturbative regime, while adding new scalars is
less desirable since they may upset the ﬁrst order phase transition. Of course, there is always
a large parameter space where they are innocuous, since even tiny couplings with the SM
particles may give enough CP violation.
One such simple extension is to introduce the fourth generation fermions whose Yukawa
couplings have potentially large CP phases [41]. Another well-motivated solution is resorting
to the extended lepton sector [42] which may also oﬀer the explanation of neutrino masses.
5.2
Testing the thermal history
As we showed, the ﬁrst order phase transition implies a window for particle masses, that can
serve as a probe at colliders. Still, one would like to have a more direct consequence that
reﬂects the cosmological dynamics. One intriguing possibility are the remnant gravitational
waves [43].
5.3
Pre-existing Baryon Asymmetry?
In order to elucidate this possibility, let us recall the problem in the conventional picture: the
sphaleron erasure [6] of any original B +L asymmetry, based on the conventional assumption
of symmetry restoration at high temperature. This, however, is not necessarily true in the
BSM physics with enlarged Higgs sector: gauge symmetry may get even more broken at high
temperature [24, 44]. For this to happen, it suﬃces that the cross-term couplings between
diﬀerent scalar multiplets be negative. It may be worthwhile to investigate this possibility;
however it requires improving the perturbative results for next-to-leading eﬀects tend to be
large [45].

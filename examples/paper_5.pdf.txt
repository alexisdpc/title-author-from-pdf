Abstract: We examine the Inert Doublet Model in light of the discovery of a Higgs-like
boson with a mass of roughly 126 GeV at the LHC. We evaluate one-loop corrections to the
scalar masses and perform a numerical solution of the one-loop renormalization group equa-
tions. Demanding vacuum stability, perturbativity, and S-matrix unitarity, we compute
the scale up to which the model can be extrapolated. From this we derive constraints on
the model parameters in the presence of a 126 GeV Higgs boson. We perform an improved
calculation of the dark matter relic density with the Higgs mass ﬁxed to the measured
value, taking into account the eﬀects of three- and four-body ﬁnal states resulting from
oﬀ-shell production of gauge bosons in dark matter annihilation. Issues related to direct
detection of dark matter are discussed, in particular the role of hadronic uncertainties.
The predictions for the interesting decay mode h0 → γγ are presented for scenarios which
fulﬁll all model constraints, and we discuss how a potential enhancement of this rate from
the charged inert scalar is related to the properties of dark matter in this model. We also
apply LHC limits on Higgs boson decays to invisible ﬁnal states, which provide additional
constraints on the mass of the dark matter candidate. Finally, we propose three benchmark
points that capture diﬀerent aspects of the relevant phenomenology.

Introduction
The Inert Doublet Model (IDM) is the simplest among the models with two Higgs doublets.
In addition to the Standard Model (SM) particle content, it contains an extra doublet of
complex scalar ﬁelds which couples to the SM scalar and gauge boson sector but not to
the fermions. Moreover, it involves a discrete Z2 symmetry under which the new scalar
doublet is odd and all the other particles are even, which makes that the new “inert”
doublet particles can only appear in even number in interaction vertices.
The IDM was ﬁrst introduced more than three decades ago in studies of electroweak
symmetry breaking (EWSB) [1]. Long after, it was proposed as a model that can pro-
vide a viable dark matter candidate according to the thermal relic picture [2, 3], since the
– 1 –

neutral scalars contained in the new doublet can be seen as weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs) and play the role of the dark matter (DM) in our universe. Due to its
rich phenomenology for cosmology and particle physics, the IDM has received considerable
attention [4–9]. Its DM candidate captures all the basic mechanisms through which the
observed relic density can be generated in WIMP models [10]: The “correct” relic abun-
dance [11] can be achieved by adjusting couplings, by approaching or taking distance from
resonances, or by co-annihilating with another particle.1
Additionally, the IDM was advocated to allow for a heavier SM-like Higgs boson com-
patible with electroweak precision tests, mh0 ≳ 200 GeV, without resorting to unnatural
ﬁne-tuning [3] (for recent work also considering this possibility, see, e.g., ref. [12]). The new
states predicted by the IDM have been subjected to collider bounds [13], and they provide
an interesting phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [3, 14–18]. While by
now a heavy Higgs boson with SM couplings is experimentally ruled out [19, 20], the model
still remains attractive due to its dark matter features. Furthermore, the IDM provides an
interesting example of interplay between DM and Higgs physics, since the SM-like Higgs
boson is one of the basic means of communication between the “dark”2 and “visible” sec-
tors of the model. Hence, both the mass and the couplings of the SM-like Higgs boson are
of crucial importance to assess whether the IDM can indeed explain the dark matter in
the universe.
With the recent announcement of the observation of a Higgs-like resonance with a
mass of around 125–126 GeV by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [19, 20], as well as
the supporting hints from the DØ and CDF experiments [21], it appears likely that the
particle responsible for EWSB (or at least one of them) has been discovered.
In this
spirit, we ﬁnd it timely and interesting to examine implications of this observation for
the IDM. Apart from the obvious consequence that the number of free model parameters
is reduced by one, other interesting features appear, as we shall describe in the present
paper. Moreover, despite the attention that the IDM has received in the community, most
studies rely on lowest order predictions only. An exception is the study beyond leading
order that was performed in ref. [22]. This work is, however, limited to the interesting case
of radiative electroweak symmetry breaking `a la Coleman-Weinberg, a scenario leading to
rather extreme parameter values. Another exception is the very recent paper [23], where
higher-order corrections to DM direct detection in the IDM are calculated.
In the present work, we perform an analysis of the IDM parameter space assuming
that the LHC is indeed observing a (SM-like) Higgs boson with a mass Mh0 ≈ 126 GeV.
In section 2, we introduce the model and the relevant notation. In section 3 we present
one-loop corrections to the scalar masses in the IDM, and expressions for the one-loop
renormalization group equations (RGEs) for the model’s quartic couplings, which are used
to study vacuum stability, perturbativity, and unitarity constraints. Experimental con-
straints from collider, low-energy, and cosmological data are presented in section 4. The
corresponding numerical analysis, which contains the main results of this work, is presented
1Coannihilation is absent, e.g., in the simpler singlet scalar model.

dubbed a “dark sector” in the litterature.

in section 5, where we perform extensive scans over the model parameter space. The im-
plications for dark matter and the interesting Higgs decay into two photons are discussed
in detail. Based on our analysis, we identify benchmark scenarios capturing general fea-
tures of the parameter space. Finally, section 6 contains a summary of our results and the
main conclusions.
2
The inert doublet model at tree level
The inert doublet model (IDM) contains, in addition to the Standard Model (SM) particle
content, a second complex scalar doublet.
The model Lagrangian is constructed so as
to satisfy an exact Z2 symmetry (parity) under which all SM particles, including one of
the scalar doublets, are even and the second scalar doublet is odd. Since this discrete
symmetry prevents mixing between the scalars, one of the doublets, denoted by H, is
similar to the SM Higgs doublet. Given that the second doublet, which we denote by Φ,
has odd Z2 parity it is inert in the sense that its component ﬁelds do not couple singly to
SM particles. The requirement of renormalizability then also forbids all tree-level couplings
to the fermion sector.
Imposing the Z2 symmetry has two further important consequences. First, the inert
doublet Φ does not acquire a vacuum expectation value.
Second, it forbids several of
the terms appearing in the general two-Higgs-doublet model scalar potential [24]. More
precisely, the tree-level scalar potential of the IDM takes the form
V0 = µ2
1|H|2+µ2
2|Φ|2+λ1|H|4+λ2|Φ|4+λ3|H|2|Φ|2+λ4|H†Φ|2+ λ5
2
�
(H†Φ)2+h.c.
�
. (2.1)
In the general case, the λi are complex parameters. Although considering this possibility
can have interesting consequences for CP-violation and electroweak baryogenesis [25–27],
in this work we limit ourselves to the case of real values. Upon electroweak symmetry
breaking, the two doublets can be expanded in components as
H =

v + h0 + iG0�
�
,
Φ =

�
H0 + iA0�
�
,
(2.2)
where v =
√
2 ⟨0|H|0⟩ ≈ 246 GeV denotes the vacuum expectation value of the neutral
component of the doublet H. The h0 state corresponds to the physical SM-like Higgs-
boson, whereas G0 and G± are the Goldstone bosons. The inert sector consists of a neutral
CP-even scalar H0, a pseudo-scalar A0, and a pair of charged scalars H±.
A phenomenologically important consequence of the Z2 symmetry is that the lightest
Z2-odd particle (LOP) is stable. If further the LOP is either H0 or A0, this (neutral)
state can play the role of the DM candidate, analogously to the Lightest Supersymmetric
Particle (LSP) in supersymmetric models with R-parity conservation.
At the tree level, the scalar masses are obtained from the potential in eq. (2.1). When
the potential is expanded in the component ﬁelds, the masses of the physical states are

As in the Standard Model, we have the scalar potential minimization relation m2
h0 =
−2µ2
1 = 2λ1v2 that can be used to eliminate the parameter µ2
1 after electroweak symme-
try breaking.
The IDM scalar sector can hence be speciﬁed by a total of six parameters
{λ1,
λ2,
λ3,

(2.9)
which can be exchanged through the above equations in favour of the physically more
meaningful set
{mh0,
mH0,

mH±,
λL,
λ2} ,
(2.10)
that is often used in phenomenological applications. It is worth noting that the parameter
λL has a simple physical interpretation as the h0 − H0 − H0 coupling at the tree level
(similarly, λS is the h0−A0−A0 coupling). In contrast, the parameter λ2, which is common
to both parameter sets, appears only in quartic self couplings among inert particles and
does therefore not enter any physically observable process at the tree level. However, it
plays a role once the theory is considered beyond leading order. In the following, we shall
make use of both sets of parameters given here.
3
The inert doublet model beyond the tree level
Most of the work that has been performed within the IDM so far, such as collider sig-
nals, vacuum stability considerations or relic abundance constraints, has been based on
pure leading-order calculations. Generally speaking, it is meaningful to go beyond tree
level when theoretical uncertainties of some calculation start to become comparable to the
corresponding experimental uncertainties. In many models this is the case, for example,
for the well-measured relic abundance of dark matter in our universe. Another reason can
be to investigate eﬀects which are absent at tree level but arise in leading order at the
one-loop level as it is the case, e.g., for the decay h0 → γγ.
In the IDM, radiative corrections to inert scalar annihilations, which are relevant for
DM phenomenology, are expected to be rather small [28]. Here, strong couplings do not
– 4 –
JHEP09(2013)106
intervene in the relevant Feynman diagrams (with the exception of a ﬁnal state vertex cor-
rection involving gluon exchange among ﬁnal state quarks), contrary to the Minimal Su-
persymmetric Standard Model, where O(αs) corrections can have a sizeable impact in this
context [29–33]. Moreover, the number of diagrams with electroweak couplings at one-loop
order is rather limited, again unlike the case of the MSSM, where electroweak corrections
can become signiﬁcant due to the very large number of contributing diagrams [34–36].
With the electroweak scale being probed by both colliders and dark matter detection
experiments, the diﬀerent new physics models are constrained and the allowed magnitude
of their couplings becomes limited. In particular, the IDM parameter space is known to
present three mass regimes for the lightest odd particle (LOP), where the observed relic
density can be obtained [3, 10, 37–39]: the so-called low- (1 GeV ≲ MLOP ≲ 10 GeV),
intermediate- (10 GeV ≲ MLOP ≲ 150 GeV), and high-mass (MLOP ≳ 500 GeV) regimes
(the distinction being somewhat arbitrary). As we shall see in the following, the low- and
intermediate-mass regimes are already quasi-excluded from the XENON100 experiment
results [40]. As a consequence, in order for the IDM to still provide DM-compliant scenarios
in this mass range, one has to rely on resonances and thresholds to achieve the correct relic
density without violating the null XENON results, which would happen for suﬃciently
large coupling values. In particular, we will see that the only points of the interesting
intermediate mass regime that survive the constraint are lying close to the Higgs “funnel”
region and the WW ∗ production threshold (see also [12, 23] for recent works on the subject),
i.e. the region where LOP annihilation is dominated by nearly on-shell h0 exchange or gauge
boson pair-production.
In this regime, given the accuracy in the experimental determination of the relic density,
a mass shift of the order of 2 GeV is suﬃcient to render a particular point in parameter
space excluded or not.3
If radiative corrections are suﬃciently large to shift the LOP
mass for which the correct relic density is observed in or out of the viable region, then
the computation of higher-order corrections can become important. This is well-known in
the case of supersymmetric models such as the MSSM or the NMSSM, see, e.g., ref. [41].
The exact values of the involved masses are also known to be essential in the case of co-
annihilation of the LOP with the next-to-lightest Z2-odd particle (NLOP). In this case, a
shift in one or both masses can change the importance of this particular channel and thus
the prediction of the relic abundance.
In order to perform arbitrary calculations at the one-loop level within the IDM, we have
implemented the particle content and the interactions (in ’t Hooft-Feynman gauge) in model
ﬁles for the Mathematica package FeynArts/FormCalc [42]. The implementation has been
performed in parallel and cross-checked with the help of the two packages FeynRules [43]
and SARAH [44–46].
3.1
One-loop corrections to the scalar masses
In the Feynman-diagrammatic approach, the one-loop corrected scalar masses are obtained
by evaluating the corrections to the two-point functions. Denoting the mass for a generic
3Note that this mass diﬀerence is also similar to the current diﬀerence between the values for the Higgs
mass extracted by ATLAS and CMS in diﬀerent channels.

where Σφ(p2) is the (again, renormalized) self-energy of the ﬁeld φ. From this equation,
two further concepts can be deﬁned. The ﬁrst is that of the running mass, which we denote
by mφ(Q). As indicated by the argument, this mass carries an explicit dependence on the
renormalization scale Q. The running mass is obtained from the inverse two-point function
evaluated at zero external momentum4

(3.2)
The second type of one-loop mass is obtained by solving eq. (3.1) for the value of p2 = M2
φ
that gives Γ(M2
φ) = 0. In practice, this equation is solved iteratively with usually very fast
convergence. Since it corresponds to a pole of the propagator, Mφ is refered to as the pole
mass. Which one-loop mass deﬁnition should be used depends on what is most convenient
in a given situation. Working in ﬁxed order of the perturbative expansion, the impact of
this choice on physical observables is a higher-order eﬀect. Below we shall make use of
both the running mass and the pole mass when studying diﬀerent aspects of the IDM.
The one-loop self-energies appearing in eq. (3.1) generally receive contributions from
scalars, gauge bosons, and fermions.
In the IDM, the diagrams involving fermions are
restricted to the SM-like Higgs boson, which is also the only state that couples singly to
the vector bosons. Generic classes of diagrams contributing to the scalar self-energies are
shown in ﬁgure 1. Working in the MS renormalization scheme, we evaluate these in the
’t Hooft-Feynman gauge, which leads to the expressions for the running masses given in
appendix A. Before showing numerical results, we should also mention that these results
4An alternative method which yields the same expression for the running masses is through the (one-
loop) eﬀective potential, see [22] for the case of the IDM.

mH± = 137.0 GeV, λL = 0.12, and λ2 = 8.6 · 10−4. In the upper panels, the running mass is

have been checked against those presented in ref. [22], and overall agreement was found
(modulo the fact that ref. [22] does not include the O(α) corrections coming from vector
boson loops). Moreover, the SM-type contributions for mh0 have been checked against [47].
We ﬁnd that the relative diﬀerence between the MS and the tree-level masses can,
depending on the exact parameter values and the chosen renormalization scale, reach up
to 30% for the SM-like Higgs boson h0, and up to around 10% for the inert scalars. In
ﬁgure 2, this is illustrated for an example scenario.5 As expected, the diﬀerence between
the pole and the running MS masses is smaller. For the example in ﬁgure 2, it amounts
to up to 2 GeV (about 1.5%) for h0 and up to almost 1 GeV (about 1.5%) for H0, which
is representative for typical parameter points in the IDM. The situation is similar for the
masses of the other inert scalars, A0 and H±, which are not shown here.
3.2
Renormalization group equations for the quartic couplings
Renormalization group equations (RGEs), when evaluated at one-loop accuracy, resum
leading scale logarithms to all orders. They are therefore useful for studying the evolution
5This scenario corresponds to the benchmark point I deﬁned in table 2 below.
– 7 –
JHEP09(2013)106
of parameters under renormalization over a large energy range. To treat all parameters at
a similar footing, we ﬁnd it more convenient here to work in the basis of quartic couplings,
eq. (2.9), rather than the mass basis. The renormalization group equations for the quartic
couplings λi (i = 1 . . . 5) are driven by the corresponding beta functions, βλi, according to
16π2
∂λi
∂ log Q = βλi = β(s)
λi + β(g)
λi + β(y)
λi .
(3.3)
The latter receive contributions from scalars (s), gauge bosons (g), and fermions (y). The
diﬀerent pieces of βλi are obtained by diagrammatic calculation.6
The results for the
diﬀerent contributions are given in appendix B. Our expressions are in agreement with
earlier results for the general 2HDM [49, 50] (recalling that in the IDM λ6 = λ7 = 0).

Constraints
The various constraints which can be imposed on the (tree-level) parameters of the inert
doublet model (IDM) have been extensively discussed in the literature. A summary is, e.g.,
given in [51, 52]. For completeness, we dedicate this section to discuss which constraints
are relevant here and how they are treated in our analysis.
4.1
Theoretical constraints
A ﬁrst class of constraints on the inert doublet model (IDM) comes from the minimal
requirement for a physically sensible and (perturbatively) calculable theory. First, it is re-
quired that the couplings should not be larger than some value which makes a perturbative
treatment meaningless. We thus demand all quartic scalar, gauge, and Yukawa couplings
to fulﬁll a common constraint
|λi|, |gi|, |yi| ≤ K.
(4.1)
A minimal condition is that this inequality be respected at the input scale where the
parameters on the left-hand side are speciﬁed. The value of K which should be imposed for
a valid perturbative expansion is then somewhat process-dependent. Considering the more
stringent requirement that eq. (4.1) remains valid under renormalization group evolution,
we can use eq. (3.3) for guidance. Since the coeﬃcients appearing in the beta functions
for the scalar quartic couplings are all O(1), it is clear that an instability (Landau pole)
will appear for |λi(Q)| > 4π in the absence of accidental cancellations. In practice, smaller
values of |λi| can also lead to instabilities, but we choose to be conservative and impose
eq. (3.3) with K = 4π as the perturbativity limit at all scales.
A second requirement is that the scalar potential, eq. (2.1), should be bounded from be-
low and that upon electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) it develops a minimum which
renders the electroweak vacuum stable, or metastable with a suﬃcient long lifetime. The
criterion we shall discuss here implies absolute stability of the symmetry-breaking vacuum,
6The renormalization group equations can also be computed by demanding scale invariance of the one-
loop eﬀective potential. For an example of this approach for the singlet scalar model, see ref. [48].
– 8 –
JHEP09(2013)106
which leads to conservative limits on the IDM parameters. Allowing also metastable con-
ﬁgurations would result in relaxed constraints; we leave a detailed analysis of this question
for future work.7 For absolute vacuum stability to hold we demand [24, 54]
λ1(Q), λ2(Q) > 0,
λ3(Q) > −2
�
λ1(Q)λ2(Q),
λ3(Q) + λ4(Q) − |λ5(Q)| > −2
�
λ1(Q)λ2(Q)
(4.2)
at the scale Q.
A ﬁnal constraint comes from the requirement that the scattering matrix (S-matrix)
of every quantum ﬁeld theory must be unitary. In the case of weakly coupled theories, it
is sensible to require that the tree-level scattering matrix elements satisfy unitarity limits,
which corresponds to imposing upper bounds on them. For the general 2HDM, the bounds
were ﬁrst derived in [55, 56].
Here, we use the form for the eigenvalues of the scalar
and vector scattering matrices of [57], and we require them to be smaller than 16π. This
corresponds to saturation of the unitarity limit with the tree-level contribution.
4.2
Oblique parameters
In models where the dominant eﬀects of new physics appear as corrections to self energies
of the (SM) gauge bosons, the eﬀects can be parametrized in terms of the three “oblique”
(Peskin-Takeuchi) parameters S, T, and U [58, 59], which vanish in a pure SM calculation.
In the 2HDM, the contributions to the U parameter are negligible, which makes it conve-
nient to work in the approximation U = 0. This assumption has been veriﬁed explicitly in
our numerical analysis. For the case of U = 0, recent experimental limits on the remaining
two parameters are [60]
S = 0.06 ± 0.09,
T = 0.10 ± 0.08.
(4.3)
These values are based on a reference (SM) Higgs mass of mref
h
= 120 GeV and a reference
top mass of mref
t
= 173 GeV. We impose the limits resulting from eq. (4.3) at the 2 σ
conﬁdence level as constraints on the IDM contribution.
4.3
Collider searches
The ﬁrst constraint from direct searches at colliders comes from the invisible decay width
of the Z boson. If the decay mode Z → H0A0 is open, the subsequent decay A0 → H0f ¯f
(or H0 → A0f ¯f for the inverse mass hierarchy) would lead to Z decay events with fermion-
antifermion pairs (f ¯f) and missing energy in the ﬁnal state. A detailed analysis has shown
that this decay is incompatible with LEP data, which implies that the decay width of
Z → H0A0 must be small. It is convenient to implement this constraint as [4, 14]
MH0 + MA0 ≳ MZ.
(4.4)
7See ref. [53] for a recent discussion of stability/metastability in the SM.
– 9 –
JHEP09(2013)106
Assuming a ﬁxed mass hierarchy MH0 < MA0, a more detailed analysis of the IDM param-
eter space with respect to LEP data leads to the limit MA0 ≳ 100 GeV [13]. Considering
both possible mass hierarchies between H0 and A0, we require
max {MH0, MA0} ≳ 100 GeV.
(4.5)
Finally, limits on the mass of the charged scalar can be obtained by considering their po-
tential pair production and subsequent decay into neutral Higgs bosons at LEP. Converting
existing limits on the search for charginos and neutralinos, which present the same ﬁnal
state topology at colliders, leads to the bound MH± ≳ 70 − 90 GeV [61]. For practical
reasons, we adopt the intermediate limit
MH± ≳ MW .
(4.6)
In order to have a neutral DM candidate, we include as a ﬁnal requirement
MH± > MLOP = min{MH0, MA0}
(4.7)
for deﬁning viable points in parameter space throughout our analysis.
4.4
Dark matter relic density
The recent results from the WMAP satellite, combined with other cosmological measure-
ments, constrain the dark matter relic density to ΩCDMh2
=
0.1126 ± 0.0036 [11]. In
most of the numerical analysis below, we require the IDM relic density (considering either
H0 and A0 as the dark matter candidate) to respect this limit within 3 σ, i.e. we demand
ΩLOPh2 to lie within the interval
0.1018 ≤ ΩLOPh2 ≤ 0.1234.
(4.8)
In some cases we shall however relax this requirement and only impose the upper bound,
ΩLOPh2 ≤ 0.1234,
(4.9)
which corresponds to the situation where the IDM contribution is only partly responsible
for the observed DM density.
A subtle point in the calculation of the relic density concerns the intermediate mass
regime, and in particular the mass interval 50–80 GeV, where the IDM is known to produce
values for ΩLOPh2 in the correct range. It has been pointed out [38, 39] that in this mass
regime, which lies close to the WW ﬁnal state threshold, contributions to the total self-/co-
annihilation cross section coming from three-body ﬁnal states can be substantial or even
dominant. In particular the WW ∗ contribution (and to a lesser extent also ZZ∗) should
be taken into account to obtain reliable predictions. For this purpose we use a modiﬁed
version of micrOMEGAs [62, 63] which includes three-body ﬁnal states’ contributions. This
micrOMEGAs version also accounts for four-body ﬁnal states with two virtual gauge bosons.
We include these contributions in our analysis, and we ﬁnd that they are not always

negligible; the eﬀect on the computed relic density can be up to a few percent.8 For more
details on the implementation of the relic density calculation we refer to the corresponding
manual [64].

Dark matter direct detection
Further constraints stem from (null) direct searches for dark matter.
Until recently,
the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross-
section came from the XENON10 [65] and XENON100 [66] experiments for the low- and
intermediate-mass regimes respectively. Recently, the XENON100 experiment presented
updated constraints on the spin-independent cross-section, which strengthen the previous
bounds by a factor of roughly 2–6 [40]. We impose these more stringent bounds in the
numerical analysis that follows.
Our calculation of the relevant spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections is again
performed using the micrOMEGAs package. It is well-known that predictions of direct de-
tection rates are not without uncertainties. One among the most important sources of
uncertainty (at least from the particle physics side) is related to the strange quark form
factor of the nucleon, fTs, which loosely speaking describes the “strange quark content” of
the nucleon. This quantity is usually parametrized in terms of the so-called pion-nucleon
sigma term σπN [67].
The value of σπN relies on experimental data that is at present
poorly known. The values which are widely used come mostly from lattice QCD and chiral
perturbation theory calculations [67–70].
Hadronic form factors, and notably fTs, are of particular importance when the dom-
inant mechanism for WIMP-nucleon scattering is Higgs exchange (as is the case in the
IDM), since the Higgs boson couples preferentially to heavy quarks and the strange-quark
density is suﬃciently large to provide a non-negligible contribution to the scattering cross
section. Since the results of varying fTs can be quite dramatic [67, 71], we perform our
calculations adopting two distinct values for this parameter: fTs = 0.2594, corresponding
to the commonly used value σπN = 55 MeV, and fTs = 0.014, a value obtained recently
from ﬁrst principles through lattice QCD methods [72]. It should be noted that, as clearly
stated in ref. [72], this study does not treat systematic uncertainties. It nonetheless pro-
vides us with an indicative value for fTs, englobing numerous recent results that point to
much lower values than previously estimated.

Numerical analysis
5.1
Setup and strategy
To analyze which regions of the IDM parameter space are compatible with theoretical and
experimental constraints, we perform a numerical analysis scanning randomly over the
model parameters. Since the ﬁrst step of our analysis will involve RGE running of the
parameters starting from the input scale (which we take to be the pole mass MZ of the

the inclusion of the doubly virtual ﬁnal states.

, with the exception of the Higgs boson pole mass Mh0. For the IDM-
speciﬁc parameters, we consider the following input ranges:
0 < λ2(MZ) < 4π,
−4π < λ3,4,5(MZ) < 4π,
(5.1)
−v2 < µ2
2(MZ) < (1 TeV)2 .
We select the distribution of µ2
2 in order to obtain a uniform distribution of the CP-even
scalar mass mH0. Moreover, in order to improve the sampling eﬃciency, we generate more
points in the regions of parameter space where points are expected to remain valid up to
high scales. The chosen ranges of eq. (5.1) are found to yield both a good parameter space
coverage and a suﬃciently eﬃcient scan with an acceptable number of viable points, both
from the point of view of theoretical constraints at the input scale and with respect to the
experimental constraints that we shall impose in the following. The reader should note
that the resulting density of points does not have a statistical signiﬁcance. The existence
of a given point is rather to be understood as a parameter set fulﬁlling certain criteria.
For the ﬁrst part of the analysis (for which the results are shown in ﬁgure 3), we do not
make any assumption on the value of the Higgs boson mass and let it vary freely within the
bounds 0 < Mh0 < 500 GeV. We remind the reader that here, and in the following, capital
letters always refer to one-loop pole masses. A sample of 106 parameter space points is
generated within the aforementioned ranges, with the only requirement that they fulﬁll
vacuum stability, perturbativity, and unitarity at the input scale MZ.
For the second scan, which is used throughout most of the following analysis, we make
the assumption that the LHC experiments have indeed observed a (SM-like) Higgs boson
with a mass around Mh0 ≃ 126 GeV. We therefore ﬁx the mass of the SM-like Higgs boson
in the IDM to lie in the range
Mh0 = 125.7 ± 0.6 GeV,
(5.2)
which is obtained by a Gaussian combination of the two experimental measurements [19,
20]. This also ﬁxes the value of λ1 at the input scale. We then sample 107 points in the IDM
parameter space,

and unitarity constraints are satisﬁed at the scale MZ.
A further important SM input is the top-quark mass, which in both scans is sampled
from the range [73]

vacuum stability, and unitarity are evaluated. As soon as one of the three conditions fails,
we record the corresponding scale, as well as the failing condition. The maximal scale we
consider is Q = 1016 GeV (the “GUT” scale), at which the evolution is terminated and
surviving points are also recorded. 2HDMC is also used to evaluate the oblique parameters
(at the input scale), and we apply the bounds from direct searches at colliders as described
in section 4.3. For each parameter space point, we evaluate the scalar pole masses from
the running parameters as described in section 3.1. This set of parameters is passed to
micrOMEGAs, which is used to compute the relic density and the WIMP-nucleon spin-
independent scattering cross section. As a ﬁnal step, we compute the Higgs decay rates
(again using 2HDMC) to check whether a modiﬁcation of the important h0 → γγ decay mode
could be reproduced in any of the viable parameter points, and to apply constraints from
invisible Higgs decays into LOP pairs.
5.2
Extrapolation scale
Our ﬁrst goal is to examine the maximal scale Λ up to which the IDM can be extrapolated
while remaining a consistent and calculable quantum ﬁeld theory, in the sense of preserving
perturbativity of all couplings, unitarity of the scattering matrix, and (absolute) stability
of the electroweak vacuum as discussed above.
We ﬁrst employ the scan with variable Higgs mass. For comparison, we also perform
the same excercise for the SM, where the only free parameter is taken to be the mass
of the Higgs boson h0.
Both analyses are performed on the same footing, using one-
loop renormalization group equations and varying the top quark mass within the limits of
eq. (5.3).9 The results are presented in ﬁgure 3, where we show the maximal extrapolation
9Far more sophisticated analyses exist for the SM, where state-of-the-art calculations rely on three-loop
RGEs for the couplings [53]. This analysis shows that the SM Higgs mass range yielding an absolutely
stable vacuum is enlarged by a few GeV compared to the lowest order prediction.

scale of the SM (left) and the IDM (right) as a function of Mh0. The value corresponding
to the LHC observation, as given by eq. (5.2), is indicated by the dashed line.
In the left-hand side plot of ﬁgure 3, we can see the two well-known SM bounds coming
from perturbativity (red), and vacuum stability (black), constraining the Higgs mass from
above and below, respectively. The width of these two lines corresponds to the uncertainty
from variation of the top quark mass. It should be noted that the Higgs mass favored by the
LHC discovery does not satisfy absolute stability in our simple one-loop analysis. A more
sophisticated analysis points towards a (long-lived) metastable vacuum for the SM [53].
The introduction of the additional inert doublet signiﬁcantly modiﬁes the extrapolation
constraints as a function of the Higgs mass, as can be seen on the right-hand side of ﬁgure 3.
While the modiﬁcation of the upper bound from perturbativity is less pronounced, the
lower one from stability is greatly relaxed, with the electroweak vacuum being able to
satisfy absolute stability up to high scales for a larger choice of the higgs mass than in
the SM case. This eﬀect is due to the contributions of the inert scalars to the potential,
that can counteract the tendency of the top quark Yukawa coupling to destabilize the
vacuum by driving λ1 negative, see refs. [76, 77]. Interestingly, this leads to a vacuum
stability constraint that only manifests itself fairly early in the RGE evolution. In other
words, parameter space points which have a stable vacuum at the input scale are likely to
remain stable up to high scales. It is therefore generally the case that one of the other two
requirements (perturbativity or unitarity) is the more constraining for Mh0 (as can be seen
From ﬁgure 3). We ﬁnd that the range for which the IDM Higgs mass can be extrapolated
up to the GUT scale is larger than that in the SM, and in particular that lower values for
Mh0 are allowed. The measured value Mh0 ∼ 126 GeV, which at our level of approximation
does not allow for the SM to be valid up to the GUT scale, see ﬁgure 3 (left), is therefore
allowed in the IDM. We expect this conclusion to hold also in a more sophisticated analysis
since, as already mentioned, the SM bound on Mh0 from stability is relaxed by the inclusion
of higher-order corrections [53]. Futhermore, allowing for metastability would render an
even larger IDM parameter space allowed, as is known to occur for the SM. A more detailed
analysis of this constraint is beyond the scope of the present work.
In the following we constrain the Higgs boson mass to the range of eq. (5.2) suggested
by the LHC discovery.
We also impose the oblique parameter and collider constraints
presented in sections 4.2 and 4.3. As before, we evolve the RGEs until one of the three
theoretical requirements fails and record the corresponding scale. The results are presented
in ﬁgure 4, where the scale Λ, at which the ﬁrst of the constraints fails, is presented against
four diﬀerent parameters/predictions of the model, namely MLOP, |MH0 − MA0|, λL, and
λ2. The colour coding is the same as in ﬁgure 3: red points fail due to the perturbativity
constraint, black points fail due to vacuum stability, and the green points are those for
which unitarity is violated at the scale Λ. We observe that, as also noted previously, the
vacuum stability constraint is relevant mostly at rather low scales Λ ≲ 107 GeV. Unitarity
violation can occur as late as the GUT scale.
From ﬁgure 4 we also learn that extrapolating the model towards the GUT scale does
not favour a particular range for the mass of the dark matter candidate (the LOP). However,
the coupling parameters are strongly constrained when reaching scales close to the GUT

parameter (bottom right). The criterion which failed at the lowest scale is indicated by the colour

scale. This is due to the requirement of perturbativity, which is much easier to fulﬁll if the
numerical values of the couplings are small. As a further consequence, the H0 − H0 − h0
coupling λL and the four-scalar coupling λ2 have to be chosen in a rather narrow interval
for the model to be valid up to the GUT scale. The mass diﬀerence between H0 and A0 is
also limited if the GUT scale validity requirement is applied. This is due to the fact that
mH0 and mA0 stem from a common mass scale, µ2, and their diﬀerence is proportional
to λ5v2 (see eqs. (2.4)). Since the quartic couplings are bound due to the perturbativity
requirement, the mass diﬀerence for valid points naturally decreases when approaching the
GUT scale.
The same behaviour is observed for the remaining coupling parameters, as shown in
ﬁgure 5 where the IDM parameter space is projected on the planes (λ3, λL), (λ4, λL),
(λ5, λL), and (λS, λL). The (light) green regions in this ﬁgure correspond to parameter
space points that pass the aforementioned constraints at the input scale MZ (constraints
from DM observables are not imposed here; they will be discussed in the next section).
Thus, they constitute the maximal phenomenologically viable regions of the IDM within
the framework of our one-loop analysis.
At the same time, we highlight in diﬀerent colours the points corresponding to param-
eter values for which the IDM can be extrapolated up to Λ = 104 GeV (red), Λ = 1010 GeV

As can be seen from this ﬁgure, the
constraints imposed at the input scale are not too prohibitive, and they are satisﬁed for
essentially the full parameter ranges considered in our scan. It can also be seen that the

physics entering at a lower scale, e.g., at Λ = 104 GeV or Λ = 1010 GeV, the allowed pa-
rameter ranges increase, cf. ﬁgure 4. Note, however, that the valid ranges for the coupling
parameters at the phenomenologically relevant scale Λ = 104 GeV = 10 TeV is already
rather reduced with respect to the input scale Λ = MZ. In table 1 we summarize the
allowed ranges for the quartic couplings, both at the input scale and after the evolution to
the mentioned scales.
5.3
Dark matter
With the previous results at hand, we now turn to the IDM dark matter phenomenology,
assuming as previously that the Higgs and top quark mass are ﬁxed within the ranges given
by eqs. (5.2) and (5.3), respectively. In ﬁgure 6 we show the predicted relic density as a
function of the DM candidate mass, MLOP (left), and the triple coupling of a DM pair to
the (SM-like) Higgs boson (λL when the LOP is H0, λS when it is A0) (right). The 3 σ
limit from the 7-year WMAP data is represented by the red-dashed region.10
From the left-hand side plot in ﬁgure 6, we can see that the correct relic density can
be achieved in the mass regimes that we described in section 3. The viable parts of the
low- and intermediate- mass regimes extend from 3 GeV up to roughly 120 GeV. From this
value and up to approximately 500 GeV, the predicted relic density is too low and it can
reach the WMAP levels again above 500 GeV. In the right-hand side plot, we see that
the values that λL (λS) can take while yielding the correct relic density lie in the range
−0.4 ≲ λL,S ≲ 0.4, with positive values preferred by the points viable up to the GUT scale.
10An updated result ΩCDMh2
= 0.1196 ± 0.0031 has recently been obtained by the Planck collabora-
tion [78]. As is clear from ﬁgure 6, using this value would not lead to a qualitative diﬀerence in our results.
In particular the resulting upper limit on the DM density remains numerically very similar, see eq. (4.9).

Figure 7. The viable IDM parameter space projected on the (MLOP, λL,S) plane imposing only
the upper limit (left) and the upper and lower limits (right) of the WMAP range of eq. (4.8). The
colour coding is the same as in ﬁgure 6.
In order to better illustrate the impact of the WMAP results, in ﬁgure 7 we project
the IDM parameter space onto the (MLOP, λL) plane, demanding that the relic density
satisﬁes only the upper 7-year WMAP limit (left), or both the upper and the lower bound
(right). In particular the right plot shows how restrictive the full DM constraint is, and
it allows to discuss in more detail the various mechanisms responsible for producing the
correct values for ΩLOPh2 in the diﬀerent mass regimes.
At very low masses, below 4 GeV, LOPs annihilate dominantly into τ pairs through
s-channel Higgs exchange.
The most energetic part of the LOP’s Boltzmann velocity
distribution can also give some annihilation into bottom quarks. The correct relic density is
achieved by adjusting λL,S which, given the relative smallness of the τ Yukawa coupling, has
to be ﬁxed at rather large values. These values decrease as phase space opens up, but also
as a larger part of the WIMP Boltzmann distribution passes the b¯b production threshold.
Above MLOP ∼ 4 GeV, the required λL,S values drop by a factor 3–4, compensating for the
larger bottom Yukawa coupling. Continuing up to roughly 50 GeV, the bulk of the points
lie on a thin strip where λL,S decreases mildly, corresponding to dominant DM annihilation
into b¯b pairs through Higgs boson exchange. We remind the reader that due to the LEP
direct search constraints, coannihilation is absent in this mass range. For MLOP ∼ 50 GeV,
we observe that the WMAP-allowed values for λL,S decrease further, approaching λL,S = 0
at precisely MLOP = Mh0/2. Two eﬀects are at play in this mass region. First, the LOP
mass approaches the point where the Higgs propagator becomes resonant. For a constant
λL value, the LOP self-annihilation cross section then increases dramatically. As a result, in
order to get the correct relic density, λL,S must attain small values. The second important
eﬀect in this mass region comes from the contributions of virtual gauge boson ﬁnal states,
and especially from W (∗)W ∗. Even for vanishing triple coupling of a DM pair to h0, there
is an additional four-vertex involving two DM particles and two W bosons. This results
from the covariant derivative terms in the Lagrangian, acting on the Φ doublet (minimal
coupling).
The strength of this vertex is thus characterized by a gauge coupling, and
does not depend on any free parameter of the model (see also ref. [38]). This constitutes a
– 18 –
JHEP09(2013)106
distinct positive contribution to the DM annihilation cross section that pushes the required
value for |λL,S| further down.
For the IDM high-mass regime, a detailed explanation for the behaviour of the the
relic density constraint has been presented in ref. [37]. Above roughly 120 GeV (the precise
value depends on Mh0 [39]), the cross section for self-annihilation, in particular into gauge
boson ﬁnal states, becomes prohibitively large for the lower WMAP bound to be satisﬁed.
We therefore see that, whereas this region is allowed in the sense of not overshooting the
WMAP limit, ﬁgures 6, 7 (left), it fails once we demand the IDM to fully account for the
measured DM density of the universe, ﬁgure 7 (right). However, for MLOP > 500 GeV, an
interesting eﬀect comes at play. The dominant contribution to the cross section of the type
H0H0 → V V (A0A0 → V V ) here comes from the longitudinal gauge boson components.
This cross section is mediated either by a direct quartic coupling, or by a t/u-channel
exchange of H0, A0, or H±, which scales as M2
H0/M2
Z (in the case of the Z ﬁnal state, and
similarly for the W). The annihilation cross section therefore becomes very large as MLOP
increases (with a similar dependence also on the NLOP mass). However, when the H0 and
A0/H± are nearly mass-degenerate, there is a cancellation taking place between the t/u
channel contributions and the four-vertex diagram. This cancellation is exact for an exact
degeneracy. For example, with λL = 0, MH0 = 700 GeV, and MA0 = 701, the relic density
would be too high, and to satisfy the WMAP bound a non-zero value for λL is required. In
this manner, the WIMP depletion rate can be balanced by varying the LOP-NLOP mass
splitting and the λL parameter to obtain the correct mixture of transverse and longitudinal
gauge bosons in the ﬁnal state. These solutions are always found for small LOP-NLOP
mass splittings, and require some tuning of the value of λL,S. In practice we ﬁnd that the
maximal allowed mass splitting for the points in our scan is of the order 10 GeV.
Further constraints from dark matter come, as we have already mentioned, from direct
detection experiments, and most notably the latest XENON100 limits on the WIMP-
nucleon spin-independent scattering cross section, σSI.
In ﬁgure 8 we show the viable
IDM parameter space in the usual (MLOP, σSI) space and confront the model to the latest
exclusion bounds from XENON100 [40] (dashed line) and XENON10 [65] (dash-dotted).
As discussed in section 4.5, we adopt two distinct values for the strange quark nucleon form
factor, and the results are shown in the left- and right panels of ﬁgure 8, respectively. In this
ﬁgure all points respect both the upper and the lower WMAP bounds. The behaviour of
the LOP-nucleon scattering cross section follows quite closely the corresponding behaviour
of the coupling λL,S in ﬁgure 7, since the only way of coupling the LOP to quarks at tree
level is through t-channel Higgs exchange (the relevant coupling being simply λL,S). It can
be seen clearly that the low- and intermediate- mass regimes are almost fully excluded.
The only surviving points are those for which the correct relic density is achieved through
a combination of small values for the λL,S coupling and quasi-resonant annihilation to
an s-channel Higgs boson and virtual gauge boson ﬁnal states. The very low mass regime
(MLOP < 10 GeV) is also excluded by the XENON10 bounds on low-mass WIMPs [65]. The
high mass regime, on the other hand, remains unaﬀected by current direct detection bounds.
In ﬁgure 8 we can also clearly observe a consequence of ﬁxing the Higgs mass to a
constant value. The resonance regime, which for a variable Higgs mass consists of an entire
region, acquires now the well-known two-branch “funnel” structure that is present, e.g.,

in models such as the MSSM, where the Higgs mass is ﬁxed to a very limited range. The
funnel extends quasi-symmetrically in two narrow regions around Mh0/2. The LOP cannot
approach too close to the resonance since the relic density would then be too low. With the
Higgs mass ﬁxed, the freedom of moving within the funnel region essentially disappears,
which demonstrates that a greater accuracy is demanded in order to assess whether a
parameter space point is excluded or not. A similar comment applies to the high mass
regime and the precise tuning of the LOP-NLOP mass splitting that we discussed above.
Moreover, we observe the anticipated, numerically signiﬁcant, impact of fTs on the
LOP-nucleus scattering cross section. As we pointed out, the driving mechanism for WIMP-
nucleon scattering in the IDM is t-channel Higgs exchange. The Higgs couples preferentially
to strange quarks, hence varying the strange quark form factor can have an impact of up
to a factor 7 in the scattering cross section. While in this particular case most of the
parameter space remains excluded, this is a transparent illustration of the importance of
knowing fTs with better accuracy to make precise statements. Using the more conservative
value, we ﬁnd that the mass ranges allowed by WMAP and direct exclusion bounds are
50 GeV < MLOP < 80 GeV and MLOP > 500 GeV.
As a ﬁnal remark on direct detection, we should mention that in a recent paper the
one-loop electroweak corrections to the LOP-nucleon scattering cross section were com-
puted [23]. According to the ﬁndings, these corrections give positive contributions to the
scattering cross section of the order of 10−11–10−10 pb, that can actually superseed the
tree-level contributions in non-negligible regions of the parameter space (in particular for
small λL values). These contributions do not depend on the IDM couplings, since the
relevant vertices involve gauge couplings, and for the most should be quite insensitive to
variations of fTs. The most striking impact is that these corrections basically set a lower
value for the scattering cross section over the full range of LOP masses, which turns out
to be within the reach of the upcoming XENON-1T experiment. This is a nice example of
the complementarity among direct dark matter and collider searches, since the high mass
regime, most probably out of the LHC reach, will be probed by the next generation of
direct detection experiments.

5.4
LHC Higgs phenomenology
The phenomenology of the Higgs-like state observed at Mh0 ∼ 126 GeV remains mostly
unchanged in the IDM compared to the SM. Since the inert scalars do not have tree-level
couplings to fermions, the SM production modes and dominant decay channels are unaf-
fected, which leaves the rates compatible with the data from diﬀerent channels measured
by ATLAS [19] and CMS [20]. On the other hand, the prediction for one of the experi-
mentally most important decay modes, h0 → γγ, can be aﬀected at leading order. In the
SM, the h0 → γγ decay is mediated by loop diagrams, where the most important contri-
butions come from W bosons and top quarks, while in the IDM it receives an additional
contribution from the charged scalars.11 Following the LHC discovery, this has also been
discussed in the context of the 2HDM [79–83].
We calculate the partial width Γ(h0 → γγ) and the corresponding branching ratio
for the points in the parameter space that satisfy the constraints, including the WMAP
bounds on the relic density. In ﬁgure 9, we show the ratio
Rγγ = BR(h0 → γγ)IDM
BR(h0 → γγ)SM
,
(5.5)
11The leading-order prediction for the decay h0 → Zγ could be similarly modiﬁed, but this mode has not
yet been observed experimentally.

which in the IDM corresponds to the modiﬁcation of the inclusive h0 → γγ rate (recall
that the h0 production in, e.g., gluon fusion, remains unchanged).
The colour coding
used in ﬁgure 9 is the same as above, where green indicates all viable points in the scan
at the input scale Λ = MZ, red corresponds to the points which can be extrapolated to
at least Λ = 104 GeV, and the black points in addition remain stable and perturbative
up to the GUT scale Λ = 1016 GeV. Considering ﬁrst the upper left plot, we show Rγγ
as a function of MH± with only the upper WMAP limit on the relic density applied.
For large values of MH± the rate decouples to the SM value (Rγγ → 1), whereas for
MH± ≲ 300 GeV, we see that the two photon rate can be modiﬁed substantially. Here
we observe scenarios with an enhancement in Rγγ above the SM, or with a suppression to
lower values. The eﬀect is most pronounced for low MH± ≲ 100 GeV, where the possible
modiﬁcation due to scalar contributions exceeds 30%. It should be pointed out that these
low values for the charged scalar mass are allowed in the IDM without contradicting either
indirect constraints from ﬂavour physics [84], or the direct LHC searches for charged Higgs
bosons [85, 86]; again, since the charged scalar does not couple to fermions. On the other
hand, values for MH± ∼ 100 GeV would limit the mass for the IDM dark matter candidate,
MLOP, to the low mass regime.
As can be seen from ﬁgure 9, an Rγγ enhancement is not compatible with requiring
a scenario valid up to the GUT scale, since these scenarios (black points) always lead to
a suppressed value, Rγγ ≤ 1. The explanation behind this is given in the lower left plot,
which shows Rγγ versus λ3. Here it can be seen that, once the WMAP constraints are
applied, the sign of λ3 must be positive for scenarios to be viable up to the GUT scale.
At the same time, the sign of this parameter governs the interference between the charged
scalar contribution and the (SM) WW contribution, and a suppression (enhancement) is
obtained for positive (negative) values of λ3.
The second set of plots in ﬁgure 9 (right) are the same as those to the left, except
that both the upper and the lower WMAP limits on the relic density have now been
– 22 –
JHEP09(2013)106
applied. These plots show important diﬀerence compared to the results where only the
upper WMAP limit is applied.
First of all, the number of allowed points is naturally
much reduced. A second, very important, diﬀerence is the complete absence of points with
Rγγ > 1 in this case. Once the (full) relic density constraint is imposed, the IDM rate for
h0 → γγ should therefore be expected to come out similar to (or below) that in the SM.
Another possibility, which is visible in ﬁgure 9, is to have more than an order of
magnitude suppression of Rγγ. This large suppression can be caused by “invisible” Higgs
decays to the LOP, h0 → H0H0 (h0 → A0A0) for MLOP < Mh0/2. The resulting low
values of Rγγ are not compatible with the observation of a SM-like Higgs boson at the
LHC, which can serve as a further constraint on these scenarios. In addition, the ATLAS
Collaboration has recently published upper limits [87] on the possible size of an invisible
branching ratio for a SM-like Higgs boson. At the observed value for the Higgs mass, this
corresponds to the constraint
BR(h0 → invisible) < 0.65
(5.6)
at 95% CL. In the IDM, when h0 decays to LOP pairs is open, the invisible branching ratio
tends to become very large. The eﬀect of applying eq. (5.6) as a constraint can be seen in
ﬁgure 10, which shows the valid points in the (MLOP, λL,S) and (MLOP, σSI) planes after
applying this bound. As illustrated by this ﬁgure, this constraint from the LHC provides
a complementary limit to that from direct detection, in ruling out IDM dark matter in the
low- and intermediate mass regimes.

Benchmark scenarios
As a ﬁnal result of our analysis, we extract three benchmark points which capture diﬀerent
aspects of the IDM phenomenology.
The scalar masses and quartic coupling for these
points are summarized in table 2.
The ﬁrst benchmark point has MLOP = 66 GeV ∼ Mh0/2.
It lies at the border
between the Higgs-funnel and WW ∗ threshold regions, where the annihilation proceeds
partly through a h0 resonance and partly into (virtual) gauge bosons. For the given point,
the combination of the two mecanisms leads to the value of ΩLOPh2 = 0.1113, which is in
agreement with the WMAP interval of eq. (4.8). The second benchmark scenario, point
II, lies in the high-mass regime, the LOP being the pseudoscalar A0. Its mass is almost
degenerate with the other inert scalars, so that the relic density of ΩLOPh2 = 0.1224 is
achieved through the interplay of pair-annihilation and co-annihilation between A0, H0,
and H±. Both scenarios I and II can be extrapolated to the GUT scale, but neither of
them present an enhanced h0 → γγ decay rate as compared to the Standard Model. Point
II is out of the reach of LHC, but might be probed by the XENON1T experiment.
Finally, point III is inspired by recent LHC observations rather than by its dark matter
phenomenology. It presents an enhanced h0 → γγ decay rate (Rγγ = 1.25) as currently
favoured by ATLAS [88], but not by CMS [89]. This scenario has a rather low relic density
(ΩLOPh2 ∼ 7·10−4). Extrapolation of this scenario is only possible up to a maximum scale
of about 10 TeV, where the requirement of perturbativity fails. Let us note that in principle

it would have been possible to ﬁnd a scenario with Rγγ ∼ 1.25 and a higher extrapolation
scale (see e.g. ﬁgure 11), but the corresponding charged scalar masses are found to be very
close to the limit MH± > MW . We have therefore chosen a more conservative point where
MH± > 100 GeV.
The fact that it is not possible to satisfy all the constraints which have been discussed in
our detailed analysis while obtaining an enhanced Rγγ within the IDM is again illustrated
in ﬁgure 11. This ﬁgure shows the correlation of Rγγ to the relic density ΩLOPh2 (left) and
the maximum extrapolation scale Λ (right) obtained from our parameter space scan. We
clearly see that points with Rγγ > 1 are only found for ΩLOPh2 < 0.1. In the high-mass
regime, due to the requirement MH± > MLOP, the charged scalar is also rather heavy, and
the branching ratio of the decay h0 → γγ is equal to the SM value. In the low-mass regime,
the LOP is light enough to allow for invisible decay of the SM-like Higgs, so that its decay
rate into photons is suppressed. In the intermediate mass region, as mentioned before,
λ3 is restricted to positive values in order to satisfy the upper and lower WMAP limits.
At the same time, a negative value of λ3 is necessary to achieve Rγγ > 1 (see ﬁgure 9).
Consequently, both conditions cannot be satisﬁed at the same time. Relaxing the lower
WMAP bound allows for points similar to our benchmark scenario II, i.e. presenting an
enhanced value of Rγγ > 1, but with a lower dark matter relic density ΩLOPh2 ≲ 0.1.
Similarly, the situation of Rγγ > 1 occurs only for extrapolation scales lower than
Λ ≲ 107 GeV, as can be seen from ﬁgure 11 (right). As discussed before, the extrapolating
to high scales puts an upper limit on the absolute value of the coupling parameters. In
consequence, the decay rate of h0 → γγ is smaller because of the limited quartic coupling λ3.

Summary
We have presented an extensive study of the Inert Doublet Model in the light of the recent
potential discovery of a Higgs-like boson with a mass around 126 GeV at the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). To this end, we have computed the one-loop corrections to the scalar
masses of the model and evaluated their numerical eﬀect. In particular, we have shown the
diﬀerence between the pole mass and the running MS masses to be of the order of a few
percent. This is sizeable in the context of dark matter annihilation, which often relies on
precise mass diﬀerences with respect to a resonance, or on the presence of co-annihilation
which is equally sensitive to the precise relations among the masses of the involved particles.

Figure 11. Correlation of the relative branching ratio Rγγ = BR(h0 → γγ)IDM/BR(h0 → γγ)SM
and the dark matter relic density ΩLOPh2 (left) and the maximum extrapolation scale Λ (right).
The colour coding on the left-hand side is the same as in ﬁgure 6.
Moreover, we examined the high-energy behaviour of the IDM when treating the Higgs
boson mass either as a free parameter, or under the assumption that the particle observed
at the LHC corresponds to the IDM Higgs boson. In particular, we require the perturba-
tivity of all couplings, stability of the electroweak vacuum, and unitarity of the S-matrix.
By employing the one-loop renormalization group equations, we have shown that these
constraints become less prohibitive than in the case of the Standard Model. More pre-
cisely, the IDM can be extrapolated up to high scales, including up to the GUT scale, for
a non-negligible range of parameter choices and for larger ranges of the Higgs boson mass,
with the experimentally observed value lying ﬁrmly within the region where the IDM can
remain valid up to very high energy scales.
We have then imposed a series of constraints coming from collider (LEP, oblique pa-
rameters) and dark matter (WMAP, direct detection) experiments, combining them with
the aforementioned theoretical requirements.
We ﬁnd that the oblique parameter con-
straints has only mild eﬀects upon the IDM parameter space, and the main result of the
LEP bounds is to push the NLOP mass above 100 GeV, which in turn results in the absence
of neutal co-annihilation in the lower LOP mass regime (roughly below 80 GeV).
As a further consequence, the relic density in this mass region is driven by the self-
annihilation cross section, which can be modiﬁed by tuning the couplings of the LOP (λL
or λS for H0 or A0, respectively) to the Higgs boson, or by approaching the Higgs reso-
nance and WW production threshold. Far from the resonance/threshold, relatively large
λL (or λS) values are required for the WMAP bounds to be satisﬁed. This also implies a
large WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section, which brings the model in tension with the
current XENON bounds. The only surviving region lies close to the Higgs resonance/WW
production threshold, where λL,S, and consequently the coupling to quarks via Higgs ex-
change, has to be small in order for the depletion rate of DM not to be too high. The
signiﬁcant reduction of the available parameter space demonstrates the crucial character
Higgs measurements can have for a number of dark matter models. Another measurement
which we have used to constrain the mass region MLOP < Mh0/2 is the upper limit on an
invisible branching ratio for the SM-like Higgs boson observed at the LHC. Here we ﬁnd
– 25 –
JHEP09(2013)106
that the current limits are complementary, and give results that are very similar in reach,
to those from direct detection experiments.
The high mass regime, on the other hand, remains relatively unaﬀected by all the
current bounds, and we ﬁnd a viable region of parameter space for DM masses above
500 GeV. This provides an interesting scenario for direct detections experiments, since it
was recently pointed out [23] that the future XENON-1T experiment should be able to
probe essentially the entire viable IDM parameter space, including the high-mass regions
that are likely to remain inaccessible to the LHC.
Finally, we have studied the interplay between the dark matter phenomenology and
the LHC Higgs phenomenology, in particular the possibility to have a modiﬁed h0 → γγ
decay rate, as still allowed by the present data. Here, the most important result of our
analysis is that enhanced h0 → γγ rate can only be achieved for a dark matter relic density
which is below the WMAP limit. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the corresponding parameter
points cannot be extrapolated to scales higher than 107 GeV with the requirement of per-
turbativity satisﬁed. Based on our ﬁndings, we have presented three benchmark scenarios
that capture the essential features discussed throughout our analysis, i.e. dark matter relic
density and detection, possibility to extrapolate the model to high scales, and an enhanced
h0 → γγ decay rate inspired by the LHC discovery and the current excess observed in this
channel by ATLAS.

One-loop beta functions
The one-loop beta functions for the running of the parameters appearing in the general
2HDM potential are known in the literature, see for example [50]. To collect everything
using a consistent notation for the IDM, we give the results of our calculation here. The
beta function for a running parameter λi(Q) is deﬁned through

and Yukawa couplings (y). The contributions to the IDM beta functions from the scalar

This review focuses on the available experimental and theoretical investigations on noble gas (Ng)
endohedral fullerenes, addressing essential questions related to the mutual eﬀects that conﬁnement of
one or more Ng atoms induces on the electronic structure, bonding, and diﬀerent properties of
fullerenes. It also summarizes the diﬀerent contributions to the mechanisms of formation and
decomplexation, the reactivity towards Diels–Alder cycloaddition reactions, the chemical bonding
situation of Ng endohedral fullerenes, and the interactions that dominate within these systems.
Evidence and preparation
Since the discovery of buckminsterfullerene (C60) by Kroto,
Smalley, and co-workers,1 one of the most intriguing features
that fascinates researchers is its hollow interior, large enough to
enclose atoms and molecules. Sprang et al.2 reported early
works on the existence of endohedral fullerenes, incorporating
metal atoms during the preparation of fullerenes using
graphite, as in the well-known case of La@C60.3,4 Over time, the
list of metallofullerenes (e.g., Sc@C60, Sc2@C60, Sc3@C60) has
been gradually increased5 and more than half of the elements
have now been conned within fullerenes.6–8 Perhaps, one of
the groups that has attracted the most attention is the non-
metal endohedral fullerenes, particularly those containing one
or multiple noble gas (Ng) atoms, see Fig. 1. These endohedral
fullerenes have been considered extremely stable complexes
from the kinetical point of view. Some of the questions that have
driven investigations of these systems are: to what extent the
properties of fullerenes are aﬀected by the encapsulation of Ng
atoms? What kinds of interactions dominate within these
systems? Can an Ng atom form a chemical bond with a cage
atom and/or with another Ng atom in a conned state? How can
Ng be inserted into fullerenes?
The rst evidence of endohedral fullerenes containing Ng
atoms came from the group of Schwarz9–11 in a series of high-
energy collision experiments. It was simultaneously described
that the collision of He and Ne with positively charged C60
q+ (q ¼
1, 2, 3) entities led to the addition of the Ng mass to the ions.9–21
Although neutralization–reionization experiments supported
the helium (He) encapsulation,11 it was indubitably not possible
to know if the ions still retained their fullerene form. However,
since the 1990s, diﬀerent methods have been developed to
encapsulate Ng atoms within fullerenes. Saunders et al.22
detected He@C60 and Ne@C60 (at the part per million level)
following the standard method of preparing fullerenes, i.e.,
heating a graphite arc at 600 �C in the partial pressure of helium
or neon. Subsequently, Saunders et al.23 incorporated argon
(Ar), krypton (Kr), and xenon (Xe) into fullerenes (Ar@C60,
Kr@C60, Xe@C60) by employing high temperature and pressure
on a mixture of fullerenes and the target Ng. It was proposed
that the encapsulation process occurs through the “window
mechanism”, where a temporary window gets formed by
breaking one or more C–C bonds within the cage. Other tech-
niques used to include Ng atoms into fullerenes are bombard-
ing fullerenes with accelerated ions24 or via the explosive
method,25 where a deliberate explosion in a mixture of Ng atoms
and fullerene in a closed place led to the desired inclusion
product (for He@C60 and He2@C60). Furthermore, a higher
encapsulation ratio (30%) can be achieved using the so-called
“molecular
surgery”
methodology,26
which
involves
an
opening of the cage, then the insertion of an atom, and nally
the closure of the cage as reported for He@C60 and He@C70
systems (see Fig. 2 for an example that proceeds via an opening
of a 13-membered ring).26,27
The properties and reactivity of endohedral fullerenes con-
taining Ng atoms have been assessed mostly by 3He NMR
spectroscopy. Surprisingly, Saunders et al.28 reported the
chemical shi of helium at �6.36 ppm for
3He@C60 and
�28.81 ppm for 3He@C70 relative to the resonance of free 3He
dissolved in 1-methylnaphthalene.28,29 The observed 3He shis
were rationalized in terms of a diamagnetic aromatic ring
current in C60 and C70 with higher intensity owing to the
diamagnetic nature of the benzenoid rings.30 Therefore, an
upeld in 3He shi reects a diatropic ring current (aroma-
ticity), and a downeld shi means a paratropic ring current
(antiaromaticity). This idea was pushed to the limit for the
hexaanions He@C60

deshielded) compounds (3He chemical shis of �49.27 and
+8.20 ppm, relative to 3He in THF-d8, respectively).29,30 These
values mean an opposite magnetic behavior compared to their
neutral analogues and a signicant change in the internal
magnetic eld and aromatic character, i.e., He@C60
6� is, in
principle, more aromatic than the parent neutral compound. In
further studies, the shielding of the encapsulated 3He core in
He@C60
6� was rationalized by the presence of a long-range
shielding cone along the entire cage due to its spherical
aromatic
character,
whereas
He@C70
6�
exhibits
a
strong
deshielding response inside the cage to the induced magnetic
eld.31,32 Also, the 3He shielding was assessed in terms of the
number of addends in arylated and cloro[60]fullerenes.33 Based
on the 3He upeld shi, Birkett et al.33 noted an enhanced
aromatic character for all the aryl and chlorine C60 derivatives
(C60Cl6–dHe ¼ �12.30 ppm, C60Ph5Cl–dHe ¼ �15.14 ppm, C60(4-
FC6H4)5Cl–dHe ¼ �15.04 ppm, C60(4-FC6H4)5
+–dHe ¼ �12.61 ppm
and 1,4-C60Ph2–dHe ¼ �10.50 ppm, C60Ph4–dHe ¼ �14.40 ppm)
relative to the parent compound due to the introduction of an sp3-
hybridised carbon in adjacent pentagonal rings and an improved
electronic delocalization in adjacent hexagons. This is associated
with the high electronegativity of Cl atom, which reduces the p-
character of adjacent carbons, and so the electron delocalisation.
A similar assessment was performed with the bis- to hex-
akisadducts of C60 and mono- to tetrakisadducts of C70.34 For the
C60 series, 3He chemical shi decreases as a function of the
degree of functionalization (from �8.11 to �11.89 ppm), whereas
in the C70 series, 3He chemical shi increases (from �27.53 to
�20.68 ppm). While this contrasting behavior in C60 is attributed
to the balance between paramagnetic pentagonal ring currents
and diamagnetic benzenoid ring currents,28 the upeld in C70 is
explained by the interruption of the diamagnetic ring current
along the corannulene perimeter.
Now, what is the inuence of the encapsulated Ng atoms on
the
13C chemical shis for the C60 cage? Murata and co-
workers27 reported the
13C NMR spectra for free C70 and
He@C70. The He@C70 spectrum is quite similar to that of C70 (d
¼ 150.91, 148.36, 147.67, 145.64, 131.15 ppm) with only two
slight signals shied by less than 0.05 ppm within the sp2
carbon region (145.66 and 131.15 ppm), revealing that He is
located almost at the cage centre. More pronounced downeld
shis of 0.17, 0.39 and 0.95 ppm are observed in Ar@C60,35
Kr@C60,36 and Xe@C60,37 respectively.
Single-crystal X-ray analysis also provided clear evidence on
the structure of Ng atoms inside fullerenes. Morinaka et al.38
crystallized He@C60${NiII(OEP)}2 (see Fig. 3a), conrming that
He is at the centre of the C60 with 100% of occupation level.
Dragoe and co-workers39 described the extended X-ray absorp-
tion ne structure for Kr@C60, while Balch and co-workers40
reported the crystal structure of Kr@C60 in (0.09Kr@C60/
0.91C60)${NiII(OEP)}2C6H6 (Fig. 3b). In the case of Ar@C60, the
endohedral nature of Ar was conrmed by X-ray photoelectron

Encapsulation and release process of
Ng atoms
From high-pressure experiments, Saunders et al.22 estimated an
Arrhenius activation energy of �80 kcal mol�1 for the release of
He from fullerene. In contrast, the computed activation barrier
for He insertion into C60 through a six-membered ring is
>200 kcal mol�1.14,19,42–44 Therefore, the release mechanism does
not follow the penetration route. From mass spectroscopic
studies, it is apparent that the Ne atom is released without
destroying the C60 cage.45 This evidence suggests that Ng release
occurs through a window mechanism or molecular surgery, in
which C–C bonds are broken to open the cage, the inner Ng is
released, and then the cage is reconstituted. In the case of the Kr
and
Xe
derivatives,
barriers
are
even
higher
than
1500 kcal mol�1 for inserting Ng through a six-membered ring
of C60.46 Other processes involving the formation of triplet states
were considered but they require even higher activation ener-
gies. Moreover, the incorporation fractions of 3He and 4He
increase in the presence of cyanide (KCN),47 suggesting that the
insertion of Ng may involve more than two species.
To obtain a better understanding of the dynamics of encap-
sulation and release of Ng within fullerenes, several molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum chemical computa-
tions were carried out. Some of the rst works employed classical
MD to study the formation process of Ng@C60 endohedral
fullerenes. Cui et al.48 reported the formation process of Ng@C60
(Ng ¼ He–Kr) endohedral fullerenes by a collision of Ng atoms
with C60 using classical MD with a Tersoﬀ and Lennard-Jones
potentials to model all the C–C and Ng–C interactions, respec-
tively. Three mechanisms of formation emerged: ring insertion,
windowing, and holes. The rst one is the insertion of an Ng into
the C60 cage through a pentagon or hexagon ring without
breaking any C–C bond, the second involves the formation of
a short window when a C–C bond is broken due to the transfer of
kinetic energy from the incident atom, while in the hole mech-
anism the same occurs, but the Ng is trapped within a defected
C60 cage. He@C60 and Ne@C60 could be formed via ring-insertion
or windowing mechanisms. Xu et al.49 investigated the complex-
ation and decomplexation process of He@C60 using quantum
chemical computations. Four possible paths were explored:
insertion of He through the centre of a ve-membered ring,
through a six-membered ring, and through the centre of the [6,6]
or [5,6] C–C bonds. In all the cases, a planar and spherical
expansion was considered. The computed barriers support the
increase of the [5,6] bond lengths, forming a 9-membered ring
window as the most probable path (�250 kcal mol�1), whereas
the other options involve barriers above 300 kcal mol�1. So, the
insertion of He into C60 is easier via the expansion of a plane
window than a spherical window.

simulations,
particularly
a
path-
sampling algorithm. The simulations included 1000 He atoms
and a C60 molecule at 50 atm and 1000 K. The analysis of
insertion trajectories reveals that the He incorporation occurs
through a window formed by the opening of three C–C bonds.
The lifetime of the opening is in the range of 50 to 150 fs, and
the insertion of He requires around 120 kcal mol�1. Previously,
Patchkovskii et al.42 computed (at the MNDO, HF/3-21G, and
BP86/3-21G levels) the barriers of He incorporation into C60
through the opening of one-bond and two-bond windows.
However, the barriers (>200 kcal mol�1) are further away from
the experimentally reported ones (�80 kcal mol�1).
The radical impurity insertion mechanism for C60X and
C60X2 (X ¼ H and Me) systems using semiempirical MNDO and
density functional theory (DFT) computations (BLYP/3-21G) was
also screened by Patchkovskii et al.51 Sixty-ve diﬀerent path-
ways for the insertion of He through six-membered rings and
diﬀerent windows in C60X and C60X2 were reported. Although
the barriers are much lower compared to C60 when an impurity
is added (i.e. C60X and C60X2), the computed values were very
high compared to the experimental ones.

Roth and co-workers52 studied the eﬀect of the Ng encapsu-
lation on C60 at higher temperatures (T ¼ 160–1500 K) using
a Lennard-Jones potential for the Ng–C interactions along with
a Brenner's empirical extended bond-order potential for the
C–C bonds. These simulations show that smaller Ng atoms sit
more oﬀ-centre than large ones and that the cage can be
stabilized or not by stiing radial uctuations. Similar MD
simulations at higher temperatures (T ¼ 4000–5000 K) indicate
that the rate of release of Ng atoms does not only depend on the
size of the Ng, but also because heavier encapsulated Ng atoms
tend to stabilize the cage against thermal uctuations.53
However, there is no evidence of a closing mechanism of the
cage aer the escape of Ng through a formed window. The same
group54 also simulated an aggregate formed by ve Ne@C60
endohedral molecules at temperatures ranging from T ¼ 1000 K
to T ¼ 5000 K. The aggregate dissociates at 1150 K, but the
carbon cages remain intact up to 4000 K, in which the Ne atom
releases the aggregate through a window that opens and closes,
but which remains as a defect at about 5000 K. Nevertheless,
based on the experiments, it was suggested the limitation of
classical dynamics to describe these systems at temperatures
below 3000 K.
Ab initio MD simulations were also employed to investigate
the formation process of He@C60 by simulating the explosion
method (vide supra). Peng and co-workers55 used ab initio MD
simulations at the PBE-vdw/DZP level to characterize the reac-
tion path for colliding He into C60 and the formation process of
He@C60. Initially, the authors computed a barrier of around
225 kcal mol�1 to insert He through a six-membered ring.
However, the defects formed on fullerene are able to decrease
this barrier. For instance, when a C2 unit is removed to form
a C58 cage, considering a Rice shrink-wrap mechanism known
in C60, He insertion can take place through a C7 or C8 rings
(Fig. 4b and c) with approximate barriers of 123.6 and

70.0 kcal mol�1, respectively, or even better, when a collision
between two C60 is simulated, the insertion barrier can decrease
to 60.0 kcal mol�1 through a C9 ring. In fact, it was reported by
tandem mass spectrometry studies that C70
+, Ne@C70
+, and
Ar@C70
+ cations undergo cage-shrinking reactions by unim-
olecular elimination of a C2 unit, which has lower activation
energies than the removal of endohedral Ng atoms.56
A detailed analysis of the dynamics of encapsulated Ng
atoms was carried out by Li et al.55 and Khatua et al.,57 showing
that for Ng atoms in the Ng2@C60 (Ng ¼ He–Kr) family, a nearly
free precession movement around its midpoint in the C60 cage
is possible, which depends on two factors, the interaction
between the Ng and the cage and the distortion of the cage
caused by the precession movement (see Fig. 5). DFT compu-
tations also predicted such behavior for the internal rotation of
Ng atoms inside the C70 cage. According to G´omez et al.,58 the
encapsulated Ng2 dimer within a C70 cage can rotate as well, and
He2 rotates more readily than its heavier analogues Ne2 and Ar2.
The eﬀect of conﬁnement on chemical
bonding
The completely lled valence shell of Ng atoms, their reasonably
high ionization energies, and low electron aﬃnities make them
very lazy species to form chemical bonds with other elements. A
really strong polarizing centre is required to deform the rigid
electron density of Ng and to attract towards itself, facilitating
a donor–acceptor type of interaction. Gold59 and beryllium,60–63
with the appropriate combination of geometrical orientation
and charge distribution, make them the best transition metal
and main-group elements, respectively, to form such type of
interaction. Another strategy of forming a strong bond involving
Ng is to push it in an extreme situation and to make the charge
distribution in a way that this atom acts as cation Ng+ and then
providing enough kinetic stability, at least, up to certain
temperatures. Metastable Ng insertion complex, XNgY is one of
such examples where Ng is inserted into the X–Y bond, sacri-
cing its strength, and the resulting charge distribution should
be (XNg)+Y�, where X–Ng bond is a strong electron-sharing
bond.64 But such molecules are thermochemically unstable
with respect to dissociation, XNgY / Ng + XY. Another extreme
situation is Ng endohedral complexes, where Ng atoms are
forced to stay within a small space. Given the many bonds
should be broken to be released from the cage, once one aﬀords
high energy to get it, the resulting Ng encapsulated complexes
would be kinetically stable at ambient even at elevated
temperatures. It provides a huge scope to force Ng atoms
towards forming chemical bonds not only with the host atoms
but also between two Ng atoms, which is otherwise unbound in
nature, only weakly supported by tiny van der Waals forces.
Given the fact that the chemical bond is a fuzzy concept (not an
observable), these Ng inclusion complexes also draw arguments
and counter ones regarding the existence of a chemical bond
involving Ng atoms.
One aspect is the energetics. Several authors reported the
interaction or complexation energies of Ng@Cn systems65–78
(Ng ¼ He–Xe; n ¼ 20–60) using the Lennard-Jones model, or
DFT and ab initio methods taking into account the dispersion
eﬀects and the basis set superposition error (BSSE). The
general trend is that if the cavity size is small, lighter Ng
atoms have more favorable interaction energies than their
heavier analogues, but if the cage size is reasonably large, the
heavier Ng atoms interact more strongly than the lighter
ones. This is because the overall interaction energy depends
on a delicate balance between attractive forces, originated
from orbital, coulombic, and dispersion interaction, which
increases linearly from lighter to heavier Ng atoms, and the
Pauli repulsion that also enhances along the same direction.
For instance, B¨uhl et al.77 reported, at the counterpoise-
corrected MP2/6-31G** level (using a DZP basis for Kr and
Xe), negative interaction energies between endohedral He to
Xe atoms and C60 of �0.3 (�2.0 at the MP2/TZP(C) + cc-
pVQZ),76 �1.9, �2.5, �7.5, and �5.4 kcal mol�1, respectively,
whereas GGA BLYP79,80 and BP86 functionals,79,81 and hybrid
B3LYP82 functional predict positive values (with BSSE). In the
cases of hybrid GGA dispersion corrected B3LYP-DCP,83 the
empirically dispersion corrected B97-D,84 and the hybrid
meta-GGA functional M06-2X,85 negative interaction energies
(with BSSE) are obtained. Sure et al.86 also nicely showed that
the inclusion of dispersion contributions87 in the Ng@C20+2n
(n ¼ 0, 2–20; Ng ¼ He, Ne, Ar) systems is mandatory in order
to get reliable interaction energies. BP86-D/TZVPP level, with
further energy renement at the ab initio MP2/TZVPP level,
was also found to be suitable to detail structures and ener-
getics of Ng encapsulated C60 complexes correctly.88 The BP86
functional combined with dispersion correction (D3 or
D3(BJ)) can also describe such systems.89 Therefore, in
general, any functional that takes into account short-range
and/or
long-range
dispersion
interactions
or
ab
initio
methods in combination with suﬃciently large basis set
would provide reliable energetics.71,86,90,91
Now, does connement induce a chemical bond? Since
connement pushes the bonding in extreme situations under
high pressure, many models of bonding are bound to fail to
explain them, starting a debate. Helium encapsulated into
C10H16 adamantane, He@adam, is one such example in which
the presence or absence of He–C chemical bonds was justied
by several leading scientists based on their personal under-
standing and views to the denition of chemical bond.92–99
While the presence of four gradient paths connecting He and
carbon atoms and the associated values of descriptors like
electron density r(rc), Laplacian of electron density V2r(rc), and
energy density H(rc) at the “bond” critical points of He–C
gradient paths lying in between closed-shell and electron-
sharing interactions advocate for the presence of chemical
bond,94
the
repulsive
nature
of
He–C10H16
interaction
(154.2 kcal mol�1) contradicts the notion of the presence of
chemical bond (see Fig. 6 for the molecular graph).91,95,97
However, note that the 1997 IUPAC denition of the chemical
bond,100 “there is a chemical bond between two atoms or groups
of atoms in the case that the forces acting between them are
such as to lead to the formation of aggregation with suﬃcient
stability to make it convenient for the chemist to consider it as

an independent molecular species”, does not demand a chem-
ical bond to be attractive in nature. Bader and co-workers94 even
argued that the interaction between He and carbon atoms
connected through the gradient path is attractive in nature. The
higher energies of the other carbon and hydrogen atoms are
responsible for the energetic instability of the complex against
dissociation. Adopting three highly symmetric systems of
varying sizes, He@C8H8 (Oh), He@C20H20 (Ih) and Ng@C60 (Ih),
Cerpa et al.98 demonstrated that irrelevant to the related Ng–C
distances, there always exist gradient paths between them,
which are driven by the symmetry, even if the presence of any
true chemical bond is very unlikely (see Fig. 6). This is obvious
that such conicting views arise from diﬀerent perspectives,
which are valid within their scope of the denition. Schwarz and
co-workers99 nally proposed that the conicts may be avoided
if such contacts are understood in the light of “connement
bonding”.
The presence of the chemical bond in Ng2@C60 involves fewer
disputes than the above example. In 2007, Krapp et al.93 made an
extensive study on the bonding situation in Ng2@C60 (Ng ¼ He–
Xe) complex. Interestingly, upon encapsulation, the Ng–Ng bond
lengths get contracted to the 56–68% of the distance in free Ng2
dimer. Inspection of the energy of HOMO and LUMO of free Ng
with those in conned Ng2 indicates a signicant elevation of
energy upon connement, particularly for Ng ¼ Ar–Xe, suggest-
ing that the Ng atoms in the conned state would have diﬀerent
reactivity than that in the free state. The charge distribution
indicates that the Ng2@C60 is low for Ng ¼ He–Kr, but remarkably
more than one electron is transferred from Xe2 to the host
moiety, making it a charge complex Xe2
+@C60
�. Importantly,
H(rc) value is considerably negative �0.341 Hartree ˚A�3 for Xe–Xe
bond in Xe2@C60, undoubtedly assigning it as a genuine chem-
ical covalent bond. On the other hand, for Kr–Kr and Ar–Ar, the
H(rc) values are still negative, although they are smaller than that
in Xe–Xe. Moreover, the reactivity of Ng2@C60 (Ng ¼ Ar–Xe) would
be considerably diﬀerent than those of free Ng and C60, which
was further conrmed by a subsequent study carried out by Sol`a
and co-workers,101 where they noticed dramatic alteration of
reactivity of Ng2@C60 with respect to C60 towards Diels–Alder
cycloaddition in case of Ng ¼ Ar–Xe. Therefore, it satises the
IUPAC denition of the chemical bond. Their analyses also
categorized the lighter He2@C60 and Ne2@C60 as weakly bonded
van der Waals complexes.
It is obvious that the C60 cavity is large enough to induce
the formation of a chemical bond between two lightest Ng
atoms. In order to check whether the bonding situation in
He2 gets changed in case of reasonably smaller host moiety
than C60, Cerpa et al.102 forced two He atoms to stay within
C20H20 cavitand. As expected, such connement in very small
space further squeezes the He–He bond length (1.265 ˚A),
which becomes 0.688 and 1.712 ˚A shorter than those in
He2@C60 and free He2, respectively. Such He2 connement in
a small cavity needs to pay a heavy price. The resulting
complex is found to be unstable by 169.8 kcal mol�1 at the
DFT level with respect to the dissociation into free He atoms
and C20H20. Except for the presence of gradient path between
two He atoms, the other bonding indices do not support the
presence of chemical bond, which led the authors to
conclude
that
short
He–He
internuclear
separation
is
a consequence of He-cage repulsion and that it cannot be
inferred as a true chemical bond.
To shed light on the diﬀerence in Ng–C interaction between
the cavity consisting of sp3 carbons and sp2 carbons, we per-
formed an energy decomposition analysis combined with
natural orbital for chemical valence (EDA-NOCV)103,104 on
Xe2@C60 and He2@C20H20 complexes. Note that because of the
diﬀerent cavity sizes, a comparison between the same Ng atom
cannot be done as obviously the orbital interaction in He2@C60
would be minimal. Here, we only emphasize how the most
dominating orbital interaction arises in these two cases. Fig. 7
displays the deformation densities and the associated fragment
orbitals of these two complexes. In the plot, the electron density
ows from the red to blue region. In the case of Xe2@C60,
�63.5 kcal mol�1 orbital stabilization arises because of almost
one-electron transfer from the antibonding HOMO of Xe2 to
LUMO of C60. Note that this transfer reduces the electron pop-
ulation of antibonding orbital, imposing net bond order in Xe–
Xe bond. On the other hand, in the case of He2@C20H20,
surprisingly, in place of 1su orbital, higher-lying 2su orbital acts
as a donor to the LUMO+2 of C20H20. It seems that in the
conned states, the energy gap between 1su and 2su orbitals
lowers, introducing some degree of hybridization between them
and some electrons from the former orbital polarizes to the
latter one. Because of larger spatial distribution than the 1su,
2su orbital can interact more eﬀectively with LUMO+2 of
C20H20. However, the degree of such electron transfer and the

associated orbital interaction is lower than those in Xe2@C60.
Such low electron depletion from antibonding orbital corrobo-
rates with the previous study102 where the He–He bond could
not be categorized as a chemical bond.
This came as a surprise when Nikolaienko et al.105 argued
about the formation of a true He–He bond even in He2@C60
based on L¨owdin's postulate. They analytically estimated the
potential energy curve of the He–He dimer conned in C60 and
then perturbatively solved the corresponding Schr¨odinger equa-
tion where they obtained at least one bound state where two He
atoms are bound with each other. The ab initio MD study on
Ng2@C60 showed that Ng2 units, including He2, undergo trans-
lational, vibrational, and rotational movements as a single entity,
without any random movement, supporting some sort of
bonding between two He atoms.57 A similar situation was noted
in Ng2 conned in a smaller cavity like B12N12, B16N16, and B40
cages106,107 where some specic descriptors support bonding and
some criteria do not. Therefore, it is only a matter of weightage an
individual wants to give. Some scientists give more weightage on
those descriptors that support the formation of chemical
bonding, but some others prefer the other way. Nevertheless, it is
fun to understand the advantages and limitations of diﬀerent
bonding models in analysing the chemical bonds formed under
such drastic conditions. This is important to enjoy the diﬀerent
avors and opportunities that connement can provide.
Chemical reactivity of endohedral
fullerenes containing Ng atoms
How signicant is the eﬀect on the fullerene reactivity due to
the encapsulation of an Ng atom? The Diels–Alder reactions
were used as a model to address this question both experi-
mentally
and
theoretically.
Saunders
and
co-workers108
compared the reactivity of a Diels–Alder reaction between
He@C60 and Xe@C60 with 9,10-dimethylanthracene (DMA)
using 129Xe and 3He NMR (Fig. 8a) and found that the equilib-
rium constant is temperature-dependent. At low temperatures,
He@C60 is more reactive than Xe@C60, while at high tempera-
tures, the opposite occurs. So, the decreased reactivity of
Xe@C60 towards DMA at low temperatures is because the Xe
atom pushes the p-electron cloud of C60 outward.
Sol`a and co-workers101,109 performed DFT computations to
determine the reaction and activation energies for the [4+2]
Diels–Alder
cycloaddition
reactions

Ng@C60

Ng2@C60 (Ng ¼ He–Xe) systems and 1,3-cis-butadiene (Fig. 8b).
For the
free C60, the reaction energies
are �20.7
and
�4.6
kcal
mol�1
and
activation
barriers
are
12.7
and
21.0 kcal mol�1 for the addition to the [6,6] and [5,6] bonds,
respectively. In the case of the Ng@C60 systems, the reaction
energies (�20.5, �20.3, �20.2, �20.3, and �20.5 kcal mol�1
from He to Xe) and barriers (13.0, 13.4, 13.3, 13.1, and
12.9 kcal mol�1 from He to Xe) for the addition to the [6,6] bond
are quite similar compared to free C60. The same is exhibited by
the [5,5] bond with reaction energies of �4.1, �3.9, �3.7, �3.9,
and �4.1 kcal mol�1 from He to Xe. However, the situation
changes for the Ng2@C60 family, the reaction becomes more
exothermic going from He2 to Xe2 at the most favorable [6,6]
bond (�20.9, �23.1, �32.2, �39.9, and �44.9 kcal mol�1) and
[5,6] bond (�5.0, �6.4, �15.9, �24.7, and �45.5 kcal mol�1). For
the activation barriers, they get decreased as the size of the Ng
increases for both most favorable [6,6] bond (12.8, 11.8, 8.4, 6.1,
and 3.8 kcal mol�1) and [5,6] bond (20.4, 20.0, 14.9, 11.9, and
5.6 kcal mol�1). In the case of the Ng@C60 family, the eﬀect of
encapsulation is almost negligible. As expected, the pyracylenic
bonds are more reactive than the corannulenic ones. Also, the
increased reactivity of the heaviest Ng in the Ng2@C60 family
was rationalized in terms of lowering the LUMO energy, a more
straining C60 cage, and the release of compression of the Ng2 in
the product.
The chemical reactivity of encapsulated Ng atoms was also
assessed using chemical descriptors such as the chemical
potentials, hardness, electron-donating, and electron-accepting
powers. Garza and co-workers110 used a spherical shell with an
attractive potential to simulate the Ng@C60 (Ng ¼ He–Kr)
systems. All the chemical descriptors were obtained using
a DPW92 functional, including a self-interaction correction.
The authors concluded that the connement of Ng atoms
increases their chemical potential and electrophilicity, while
there is a reduction in the hardness, suggesting a general
increment of the reactivity.
Bil et al. reported other approaches to assess the inuence of
Ng (Ng ¼ He–Rn) on the reactivity of fullerenes.111 They showed,
using ab initio molecular orbital and MD simulations, that the
presence of the endohedral atom inuences the ozone ring-
opening reaction in Ng@C70O3, but there is almost no eﬀect
on the relative stability of the C70O3 isomers by including Ng
atoms. The authors also noted that the enthalpy of reaction
depends on the isomer considered. For instance, in the case of
the c,c-C70O3 isomer, the reaction prole is not aﬀected by the
encapsulated Ng, whereas for a,b-C70O3 isomer, the enthalpy of
reaction increases and for e,e-C70O3 decreases with the heaviest
Ng atoms.
Fern´andez et al.112 analysed the governing factors for the
enhanced reactivity of the Diels–Alder cycloaddition reaction
between Ng2@C60 (Ng ¼ He–Xe) and 1,3-butadiene using the
activation strain model in combination with the energy
decomposition analysis. In the case of He2@C60, the reaction
energy
(�31.8
kcal
mol�1)
and
the
activation
energy
(13.3 kcal mol�1) are comparable to free C60 (�32.1 and
12.7 kcal mol�1, respectively). A stronger eﬀect on the kinetics
and thermodynamics is shown for the heavier encapsulated Ng
atoms compared to the empty one. The reaction energies are
�33.6, �43.1, �51.2, and �56.4 kcal mol�1 and the activation
energies are 12.4, 9.7, 7.5, and 6.9, respectively, along Ne–Xe.
From the analysis of a complete activation strain diagram along
the C–C forming bond distance, it is apparent that the stabi-
lizing interaction between the reactants is mainly responsible
for the lower computed barriers. The energy decomposition
analysis supports that the electrostatic interactions (40–42%)
and orbital interactions (43–47%) contribute almost equally to
the total interaction energy where the latter term arises as
a result of a strong orbital interaction between the cage and the
diene induced by a change in the electronic structure of the cage
due to the presence of an Ng atom. Thus, the insertion of an Ng
dimer leads to remarkably enhanced interaction between the
deformed reactant along the reaction coordinate.
Last but not the least questions
What is the smallest carbon fullerene able to conne an Ng?
From DFT computations, Sure et al.86 investigated the smallest
fullerene skeleton that can encapsulate Ng ¼ He, Ne, Ar atoms
in an energetically favorable way. They considered Ng@C20+2n (n
¼ 0, 2–20; Ng ¼ He, Ne, Ar) endohedral fullerenes. Although
even Ng@C20 complexes are minima on the potential energy
surface, a larger space is required to minimize the repulsion.
Only attractive interaction (including zero-point energy correc-
tion) between Ng and fullerene is noted for the He@C50,
Ne@C52, and Ar@C58 complexes. Through their two diﬀerent
sets of DFT computations (PBE/def2-TZVPP and PBE-D3/def2-
TZVPP), the authors also justied the essence of taking care
of dispersion interaction into the computations to get reliable
energetics. Therefore, an Ng endohedral fullerene as small as
Ng@C20 can be kinetically stable up to a certain extent, but
enough large space (C50 or larger cage) is required to make it
energetically stable. However, up to date only those with n $ 60
have been reported experimentally.
What is the maximum number of Ng atoms contained into
a fullerene? Although evidence of more than one Ng atom
encapsulated in fullerenes was already known, Tonner et al.88
were the rst to address the question using quantum chemical
computations. C60 is able to t a maximum of 40He, 17Ne, 7Ar,
6Kr, or 6Xe atoms. Interestingly, there is a quadratic depen-
dence for the dissociation energy with increasing the cluster
size and for the volume of the C60 cage with an increasing
number of endohedral atoms. The decomposition of the
dissociation energy into three terms, viz., the compression of
the Ngn cluster, the deformation of the C60 cage, and the
repulsive interaction between the Ngn cluster and the C60 cage,
the last term is mainly responsible for the increased instability
along the gradual cluster growth. The same question was
considered for the bigger C80 cage, where the maximum
number of encapsulated Ng atoms increases up to 46He, 24Ne,
or 10Ar atoms.113 Cage opening mechanisms were also reported
for C80 encapsulating up to or more than 50He, 25Ne, or 12Ar
atoms via a “molecular cart-type” structure. In both cases, C60
and C80 are very strong cages with outstanding resistance to
high internal pressures.

Can the encapsulation of Ng atoms in a fullerene stabilize
other isomers? Merino and co-workers114 studied the stability of
defected fullerenes by encapsulating two Ng atoms inside C60. In
fullerenes, the isomers with an isolated pentagon surrounded by
hexagons are more stable than those with two pentagons sharing
an edge since it prevents the formation of antiaromatic pentalene
units (Isolated-Pentagon Rule, IPR). When Xe2 is conned in C60,
the most energetically stable isomer (by 7.0 kcal mol�1) does not
follow IPR,115 rather it has a Stone–Wales defect. The energy
decomposition analysis shows that the stability of the Xe2@C60
fullerene with a Stone–Wales defect comes from a lower orbital
and electrostatic contributions by 39.4 and 24.5 kcal mol�1
(relative to the IPR one) and a decreased steric repulsion between
the endohedral Ng dimer and the C60 cage due to the ellipsoid
shape in the defected fullerene.
Final remarks
Since the discovery of endohedral fullerenes containing Ng
atoms in the early 1990s through mass spectroscopy experi-
ments, substantial experimental and theoretical research has
been conducted. Over time, various techniques have been
developed for the formation of these endohedral fullerenes
under extreme conditions (high temperature or pressure) or by
molecular surgery. To date, fullerenes containing one or two Ng
atoms have been reported. These systems have particular
attraction because the guest atoms are, in principle, considered
to be inert. However, spectroscopic experiments and quantum
computations have proved changes in the properties, bonding,
and reactivity of these species. Therefore, derived from the
eﬀects induced by conned Ng atoms, the magnetic behavior of
the C60 or C70 cages, bonding, the reactivity of C60 to Diels–Alder
cycloaddition reactions, and associated kinetics and thermo-
dynamics, along with other electronic properties have been
detailedly assessed. MD simulations and quantum chemical
computations have been used to model the mechanism of
formation/release of endohedral fullerenes, encapsulated with
Ng atoms. In addition, the electronic structure and the
predominant interactions between encapsulated Ng atoms and
fullerene cages along with the reported factors that determine
the energy prole for Diels–Alder cycloaddition reactions have
been addressed. In general, more pronounced eﬀects are ach-
ieved when heavier Ng atoms or a pair of them are encapsu-
lated, such as an enhanced reactivity for the latter case. The
future scope of this eld is enormous. In place of bare cavitand,
it would be interesting to insert Ng atoms in metallofullerenes
and to check the resulting energetics and reactivity. The eﬀect of
the external electric eld on the interaction and bonding in
inclusion complexes is another unattained topic. Eﬀorts should
also be made about how the stability of Ng encapsulated
complexes can be enhanced through doping the fullerenes.
Thus, the endohedral fullerenes containing Ng atoms have
shown more interesting chemistry than expected.

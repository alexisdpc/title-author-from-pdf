Two-Higgs-doublet
models
predict
nonstandard
physical
effects
through
the
interactions
of
charged
Higgs scalars.
We analyze
the experimental
measurements
that bound
these effects and
quantify
the resulting
constraints
on the charged-Higgs-boson
mass and coupling
parameter
tanP.
We consider
low-energy
data relating
to Bd-8 d, D -D, and E -K
mixing,
and high-energy
mea-
surements
at pp colliders
relating
to searches for the top quark
and events with large missing ET.
Our analysis
systematically
takes account of theoretical
uncertainties
in bag factors, decay con-
stants,
and quark
mixing
matrix
elements
by Monte Carlo sampling.
We combine
our results to
determine
the regions in the charged-Higgs-boson
parameter
space that are consistent
with present
data.
An important
result is that the Collider Detector at Fermilab
top-quark
mass bound
m, & 77
GeV can probably
not be evaded by appealing
to t~bH+ decays, since only a very small sliver of
parameter
space is consistent
with m, & 77 GeV in this scenario.
Consistency
with either the CERN
NA31 or Fermilab
E731 e'/e measurements
is possible.
The rare decays B~E*y, K+—+m+vv,
and EL ~pp are also examined
in these models within the context of our combined
analysis.
I. INTRODUCTION
The standard
model
(SM) of electroweak
interactions
has
been
remarkably
successful
in
describing
physics
below the Fermi scale and is in complete agreement'
with
all experimental
data.
However,
the
Higgs
sector
has
remained
elusive,
and there exists no experimental
infor-
mation
on
its nature.
The
possibility
of an
enlarged
Higgs sector beyond
the minimal
one-doublet
version of
the SM (Ref. 2) is thus consistent
with data and has re-
ceived
substantial
attention
in the literature.
The sim-
plest extensions
are models
with two Higgs doublets
(re-
quiring
the existence of charged
Higgs bosons) which are
present
in many
scenarios
beyond
the SM, including
su-
persymmetry
(SUSY), Peccei-Quinn
models,
spontane-
ous CP violation,
and E6 superstring-inspired
theories.
Because of the lack of direct experimental
knowledge,
it
is prudent
to combine
all information
on the indirect
effects of charged
Higgs
bosons
in order to place con-
straints
on this sector.
In this paper we focus on possible
charged-Higgs-boson
contributions
to
low-energy
pro-
cesses, such as Bd-B d and D -D
mixing, km~, and e, as
well as the influence of charged
Higgs bosons on the top-
quark
search and missing-ET
measurements
at pp collid-
ers.
The results
from
this combined
analysis
are then
used to restrict the parameters
in the charged
Higgs sec-
tor and determine
the region which
is consistent
with all
data.
We then make predictions
for the charged-Higgs-
boson contributions
to e'/e and the rare decays KL ~pp,
E+—
+m.+vv, and B~I%'*y.
The phenomenology
of charged
Higgs bosons has been
previously
considered.
'
However,
our present
reex-
amination
of possible
restrictions
that current
data may
place on the charged
Higgs section is well motivated
for
several reasons.
(i) We perform
a simultaneous
analysis of several
low-
energy
processes
and recent
Fermilab
Tevatron
collider
data mentioned
above and combine
these results
to ob-
tain the overall allowed
region of parameter
space in the
charged
Higgs sector.
Such a comprehensive
analysis
(in
particular,
the inclusion
of CP violation
and pp collider
data) does not exist in the literature.
(ii) Some of the relevant
pieces of experimental
data are
new; others have either improved
or changed
substantial-
ly since previous
studies
were performed.
As we will see
below,
the
corresponding
results
are thus
significantly
different.
(iii) We thoroughly
investigate
the entire possible range
of charged-Higgs-boson
and top-quark
masses,
m
y and
m„respectively.
With the likely
possibility
of a heavy
top quark, '
the approximation
m, &&m
+ used in early
analyses
may
be invalid.
We rederive
basic formulas
where
needed
with
no approximations,
and include
the
case m
+&m, .
(iv) We fully
explore
the freedom
in the Kobayashi-
Maskawa'
(KM) matrix,
as well as the uncertainties
in
hadronic
matrix
elements
and decay constants
using nu-
merical techniques.
In the remainder
of this section we give a brief review
of the two-Higgs-doublet
model.
In Sec. II we present
the detailed
calculations
of charged-Higgs-boson
contri-
butions
to low-energy
processes.
Using
numerical
tech-
niques
we extensively
sample
the parameters
in the KM
matrix
and subject them to restrictions
from experimen-
tal data on the values of the KM matrix elements
as well
as unitarity
considerations.
The uncertainties
in the ha-

dronic
matrix
elements
and
decay
constants
are
also
thoroughly
investigated.
We compare
our
predictions
with
data for Bd-B d and D -D
mixing,
e, and km&,
and obtain
the range of charged
Higgs parameter
space
which
is consistent
with
low-energy
experiment.
Using
these restrictions
we then predict
the value of e'/e and
the decay rates for b ~sy, E+~~+vv, and KL ~IMAM in
the two-Higgs-doublet
model
and compare
to the corre-
sponding
SM values.
In Sec. III we use various
bounds
from the top-quark
search and missing-Ez
(gz ) measure-
ments of the Collider Detector at Fermilab (CDF) Calla-
boration'
to constrain
possible
top-quark
decays
into
charged Higgs bosons.
We find that the CDF data can be
used
to rule
out
large
regions
of parameter
space for
m, ~ 80 GeV. We then give a brief summary
of our con-
clusions in Sec. IV.
There are several classes of two-Higgs-doublet
models
which
naturally
avoid
tree-level
Aavor-changing
neutral
currents
that can be induced
by Higgs-boson
exchange. '
One choice, hereafter
called model I, is where
one dou-
blet $2 gives masses to all quarks and leptons and the oth-
er doublet
Pi essentially
decouples
from fermions.
In a
second
model
(model II) one doublet
tI)2 gives
mass
to
charge
Q =+—
',
quarks
(and
possibly
neutrinos)
and
another
doublet P, gives mass to charge
Q = —
—,' quarks
and Q = —1 leptons.
Two other models are also possible
(models III and IV) in which
the down-type
quarks
and
charged
leptons
receive mass from different
doublets.
A
summary
of which
type of fermions
couple to P, and $2
in models I—IV is given in Table I. Each doublet
obtains
a vacuum
expectation
value (VEV) u; subject only to the
constraint
that
v
& + v 2 =v, where
v is the usual VEV of
the SM. The generic charged Higgs coupling
to fermions
in models I—IV (assuming
massless neutrinos)

couplings
in the four models we show the branching
frac-
tion 8(H*~rv) as a function of tanP for each model in
Fig. 1. The difference
in 8(H+~rv) between
models II
and IV is noticeable
only for tanp) 2 and is due to the
fact that m, &0. The difference between
models I and III
becomes large for tanp) 2 and is due to the fact that the
m, term in model III is proportional
to tan p. Model II
is that which
is present
in SUSY and E6 theories,
and is
the model
which
has gained
the most
attention
in the
literature.
In this paper we present
results for both mod-
els I and II. However,
we note that the charged-Higgs-
boson contributions
to processes
which
depend
only on
the quark sector (e.g., the processes
examined
in Sec. II)
are the same in models I and IV and in models II and III.
Thus our results presented
in Sec. II for models I and II
also apply for models IV and III, respectively.
Similarly,
as
long
as
the
m, cotp
coupling
dominates
over
the
mbtanp
coupling
in the AH vertex (i.e., for tanp& 2.0 as
seen in Fig. 1) model III is substantially
equivalent
to
model I and model IV is equivalent
to model II for the
high-energy
effects studied in Sec. III.
The mass m

rameters

two-doublet
model.

This
hierarchy
occurs
naturally
from
the
renormalization-group
evolution
in supergravity
and E6
superstring-inspired
models, but need not be the case in
a general
two-doublet
model.
The current
experimental
bound
on the H —
+ mass
is m +) 19 GeV from DESY
PETRA (Ref. 20), and it is expected
that experiments
at
KEK TRISTAN
will be able to set the limit
m
+ ~25
GeV. ALEPH (Ref. 21) has recently reported
the bounds
of m ~&30 GeV with
a value of 8(H*~cs)=100%.
and
m
~ &42
GeV
with
8 (H ~rv) =100%.
In
minimal
SUSY models
m
+ is restricted to lie above M~
(Ref. 22), while
the bound
is less stringent
in E6 super-
string
models
giving
m
~ & 53 GeV (Ref. 23). Recent
limits ' on the mass of the SM Higgs boson from ALEPH
at CERN can be used
together
with the mass relation-
ships between
the Higgs and gauge bosons in SUSY mod-
els to severely
constrain
m
+ and tanp in these theories.
However,
there
are
no theoretical
restrictions
on
the
value of m
+ and tanP in general two-doublet
models.
In principle,
constraints
on m
g can be obtained
'
by
evaluating
the H
contributions
to the p parameter
(the
ratio of neutral-current-to-charge-current
strengths
in the
effective
low-energy
Lagrangian).
However,
in practice,
these constraints
are quite dependent
on the other param-
eters present
in the theory
(such as the masses of the neu-
tral Higgs
bosons)
and are generally
very model
depen-
dent.
In SUSY models, in which there exist particular
re-
lationships
between
the masses of the Higgs
and gauge
bosons, the charged-Higgs-sector
contributions
to p vary
substantially
with
tanp,
but
are
always
small
giving
[~p[ & 10-'.
Clearly,
any constraints
on m
~ and tanP from low-
energy
and hadron
collider data
will be strongly
depen-
dent on the value of the top-quark
mass. If 100 Jo of the
t-quark
decays proceed
through
SM charged-current
in-
teractions
then
the existing
limits
on the top mass are
m, &77 GeV from CDF (Ref. 16), m, &40.7 GeV from
Mark II (Ref. 27), and m, & 44. 5 GeV from OPAL (Ref.
28). If the decay t ~H
b is possible, the CDF bound
is
invalidated.
'
Mark II has investigated
this potential
de-
cay mode and places the lower bound
m, )40 GeV for
m&+=25 GeV with 8(H+ ~rv) &70% a—
nd
similarly,
OPAL sets the limit
m, )45.2 GeV for 23~ m
+ &38
GeV with 8 (H +~rv) =0.
—
One can place
some
semiquantitative
restrictions
on
m
+ and tanp by requiring
that the H +width not be too-
large and that the tbH coupling
remain
perturbative.
It
is clear from Eq. (1.1) that the width
and tbH coupling
both grow rapidly
with increasing
m, and hence pertur-
bation theory may become endangered
for some values of
the parameters.
If we demand
that
the theory
remain
perturbative,
a bound
on tanp as a function
of m, is ob-
tained.
Of course, one should
be aware
that
validity
of
perturbation
theory is not a physical limitation,
but it is a
limitation
on the theoretically
accessible
region.
There
are various
possible
ways to define the boundary
of the
perturbative
region.
A simple empirical
prescription
is to
require that I /m should not be too large, e.g., I /m

bound
as in Eq. (1.3). Alternatively,
one may define the pertur-

cou-
plings; e.g., if we require
the tbH coupling
to be smaller
than
the QCD coupling
g, =4ma, (M~)=1.5 we obtain
the result
tan

as the definition
of the perturbative

%e will use
the constraint
(1.5) in our following
analysis.
The above
bounds
apply
equally
to models I—IV. In models II and
III there
are also corresponding
upper
limits
on tanp,
arising
from
the
tbH
coupling
proportional
to
mb V,„tanp;
these
limits
are
obtained
from
the
above
equations
by
replacing
m, ~mb
and tanp~cotp,
and
give tanp& 100—200. Perturbative
limits can also be ob-
tained
from
an
examination
of the
one-loop
heavy-
fermion corrections to the ZH+H
vertex and result
in
quantitatively
similar
bounds
to those of Eqs. (1.3) and
(1.5).
II. CONSTRAINTS FROM I.OW-ENERGY DATA
In this section
we first review
the analytical
calcula-
tions for each process that
we consider
and present
the
results from our combined
analysis at the end.
A. Neutral
meson mixing
1. 8 -8
mixing
It has been shown
that charged
Higgs bosons can give
sizable contributions
to Bd-B d mixing
and can account
for the observed
value of this mixing
at ARGUS and
CLEO without
requiring
the
top
quark
to be heavy.
Bd-B d mixing proceeds through
the box diagrams
shown
in Fig. 2 (with
q =b), where contributions
due to W, H,
and P (P being the unphysical
Higgs field in the SM) ex-
change are all included.

The QCD corrections to the charged-Higgs-boson
con-
tributions
have not yet been calculated.
However,
it is
reasonable
to assume that these corrections
are about the
same as those for the 8' and unphysical-Higgs-boson
ex-
change
diagrams.
We can in fact test the sensitivity
to
this choice by comparing
the case where the corrections
are included
in A~H and
AzH with the case where they
are not.
We find that
in both cases our resulting
con-
straints
on m
~ and tanP are basically the same.
We in-
clude
the QCD corrections
in all contributions
to Eq.
(2.1).
In
our
numerical
evaluations
we
take
n, =0.85,
mB = 5 275
GeV,
M~ =800
GeV,
mb = 5
GeV,
rs =(1.15+0.14) ps (Ref. 30), and following
Ref. 34 we
let fsB3~ lie in the range 100~fsB&
~180 MeV. Re-
cent
lattice
computations
find
values
for fsBs~
of
105+35 MeV (Bernard
et al. ), 130+20 MeV (Hamber),
and —120 MeV
(Gavela
et al. ), which
are consistent
with
our
range.
The
combined
ARGUS
and
CLEO
data
measure
the ratio of like-sign to unlike-sign
dilep-
tons
from Y(4S)~BdB d states
which
gives the result
xs =0.70+0. 13, where xs =b,Ms/I s .

(2.4)
due to the hierarchial
structure of the KM matrix; hence
B,-B, mixing
is constrained
to be maximal
in the SM.
This result
also holds in two-Higgs-doublet
models
since
t-quark
dominance
persists
in the 0* contributions
and,
as can be seen from Eq. (2.1), the same KM factors are in-
volved in both the SM and H* terms.
Thus R has rough-
ly the same value in the presence of H —bosons as it does
in the SM.
2. D -D
mixing
D -D
mixing
is also mediated
by the Feynman
dia-
grams presented
in Fig. 2 with q =c, d~u, and c,t~s, b.
The

The
SM box-
diagram
contributions,
in which the b quark
is dominant
and
the
external
momentum
terms
(proportional
to
m, /mb
) are no longer negligible,
are quite small
giving
AMD =10 ' . However,
the long-distance
contributions,
consisting of mm. and KK intermediate
states, are estimat-
ed
to be larger
giving AMD-0. 7—30X10 ' . We find
that
the charged-Higgs-boson
contributions
can also be
significant,
and
demand
that
these
H — contributions
alone not exceed the experimental
bound on AMD.
Including
the terms
arising
from
the charged
Higgs
couplings
to the
masses
of the
external
quarks
(i.e.,
m, cotP), the 0

contrib—utions to EMD are

A~~(x, ) is given
by the SM (Ref. 32), and the expres-
sions for the functions
A are given
in Appendix
A. For
completeness
we have included
the contributions
to AHH
and
A~H that
arise from the mbtanP
term
in the tbH
coupling.
This extra coupling
results
in a term which
is
of relative
size (mblm, )tan P and
can give
significant
effects when tanP is large, i.e., for tanP & 5 it can compete
with the m, cotP contribution.
In contrast,
the contribu-
tions from
the external
momentum
of the
b quark
are
proportional
to mb!m, and are approximately
the same
size as they are in the SM (of order
5—10%%uo) and hence
we neglect
the b-quark
external
momentum
here.
The
dominance
of the t quark
in the loops is assumed
and in
the
limit
of mb=0
our
results
agree
with
those
of
Glashow
and Jenkins.
The corresponding
expression
for
AMs in model I is also given by Eq. (2.1) with tanP~1 in
the formulas
for
AHH
and
A~H given
in Eqs. (A2) and
(A3). Since the H* coupling
proportional
to m, cotP gen-
erally
dominates
in Eq. (2.1) the limits
on the charged
Higgs
parameters
from B -B
mixing
do not differ be-
tween
models I and II for values of tanP
in the range
0.1—100. The relevant
hadronic
matrix elements
contrib-
uting to Eq. (2.1) are

bution
in Eq. (2.5) involves
the Higgs-fermion
coupling
proportional
to
m&
and
hence
D -D
mixing
does
differentiate
between
models I and II. The expression
for
b,MD in model I is given by the substitution
tanP~cotP
in Eq. (2.5) and tanp —+1 in Eqs. (A2) and (A3). As dis-
cussed
below,
we
find
that
D-meson
mixing
only
con-
strains
the charged
Higgs sector in the case of model II
(and then only for very large tanp, i.e., tanp~
few X 10,
which
is beyond
the perturbative
limit); there are no ad-
ditional
restrictions
in model I after the constraints
from
B -B
mixing
are taken into account.
Numerically,
we
set mD=1. 87 GeV, m, =1.5 GeV, ~D=4.28X10

s,
and consider fDBD
to lie
in the range 170+50 MeV.
Note that
the value fDBn~ =120 MeV gives the most
conservative
limits from Eq. (2.5) and hence is the value
we use in our calculations.

the inAuence of charged
Higgs bosons on
the El-K~
mass
difference.
These
contributions
are
again
represented
by the box diagrams
in Fig. 2 with
q =s.
The
short-distance
contributions
to
b,M~
are
directly
related to the BI Bz mass difFe-rence
via (in both
models I and II assuming
m, =0)

however,

B. CP violation
l. e parameter
As is we11 known,
the parameter
e is a measure
of CP
violation
in the physical states of the K -K
system.
The
general expression
for e is given by the imaginary
part of
the off-diagonal
matrix
element
(ImM, z) of the hS =2
effective Hamiltonian
as
~i m!4
e=

&2b M»
(2.9)
in the reasonable
approximation
that the imaginary
part
of the EI= —,' transition
amplitude
is neglected
in com-
parison
to its real part, and where M, z is given
by the
off-diagonal
element
of the K,K
mass
matrix.
The
charged-Higgs-boson
contributions
to M, z arise from the
Feynman
diagrams
displayed
in Fig. 2 with q =s. The re-
sulting
expression
for e is (in both models I and II with
m, =0)
with fK =160 MeV and mz =0.497 GeV. The SM calcu-
lation for AM+ is plagued
by uncertainties
from long-
distance
effects,
as
well
as
short-distance
strong-
interaction
corrections
and
evaluation
of the hadronic
matrix
elements.
However,
the KL-Kz mass
difference
has
been
widely
used ' to constrain
new
physics
by
demanding
that the new physics contributions
not exceed
the experimental
determination
of AM+.
We thus

quire that (with AM+ as calculated

lies in the value of the bag factor Bz, which

we
first
conservatively
assume

we
find
that
this
limit
has
no
significant
effect on our bounds.
After
all of our con-
straints
are combined,
we then restrict e' je to lie within
the +2o range of the published
NA31 data and obtain
further constraints
on two-doublet
models.
Defining
R to be the

R = I 1+cot P[FH(yt )

Fa,(x, )]—
I, e' je is given by
AM
(2.23)
Deviations
of R from unity
are due to the effects of the
charged-Higgs-boson
contributions.
In the SM the ex-
pected value of e'/e lies in the approximate
range
10
&e'/@&10
. In Fig. 4 we display R as a function
of tanP for various
values of m, and
m
~. Clearly, for
smaller
values
of tanP
and
m
y (e.g., tanP&0. 2 and
m
~ & 100 GeV) the H* penguin
contributions
are large
and negative.
For some values of the parameters
(name-
ly, tanP&0. 3 and
m
y &250 GeV), the predicted
value
of e' je is found to be quite small and negative
and can be
consistent
with the preliminary
Fermilab E731 data. For
other
values
of the
parameters
R = 1
(namely,
for
tanP &0.4}and e' je is found to agree with the data of the
NA31 experiment
at CERN.
It has recently
been emphasized
that the electromag-
netic penguin
(i.e., y and Z exchange} contributions
to
e'je may
be significant
(especially
if the top quark
is
heavy),
having
the effect of reducing
the predicted
value
of e'/e.
Presumably,
the H* contributions
to the elec-
tromagnetic
penguin
diagrams
may
also be large

are easily
calculable
from the general
expres-
sions contained
in Ref. 14). However,
the calculations
of
the matrix
elements
for the appropriate
operators
are
even more uncertain
'
in this case than for the gluonic
penguin,
and
thus
we ignore
electromagnetic
penguin
effects in our analysis.
The influence of charged
Higgs bosons on the electric
dipole moment of the neutron (d„) has been recently con-
sidered,
' where it was found that the predicted
value of
d„ in two-doublet
models is approximately
the same as in
the SM (d„=10
*'). Given the present
gap ' between
experimental
limits (d„510
) and the SM prediction
for d„, it is impossible
to restrict the parameters
in two-
doublet models from these considerations.

Radiative 8 decays

b ~sy via the generic Feyn-

This

the predicted

in the two
cases. The branching

It has been shown
that the QCD radiative
corrections
significantly
enhance
the rate for b ~sy, since they have
the effect of replacing
the rn, /MII

sion in GII, with a m, /MII, logarithmic
suppression.
As
pointed out in Grinstein

are applied to the dipole transition
operator of the matrix
element

to this operator
(in
this case from the SM and H*) receive the same QCD ra-
diative corrections.

It is clear from Fig. 5 that especially
large enhancements
or suppressions
of the branching
fraction are possible
in
model I. This is due to the fact that a =—cot pin model
I and can thus cause destructive
interference
with the SM
contributions.
This destructive
interference
between
the
SM and H* terms does not occur in model II, where the
charged-Higgs-boson
contributions
are found
to always
enhance
the SM rate.
Note that for some values of the
parameters
(namely, tanpR
1 for m
~ & 100 GeV) the to-
tal branching
fraction already exceeds the present experi-
mental limit.
D. KL, ~pp,
Interest
in the process Ki ~pjM has been revived
due
to two new measurements
of its branching
fraction of
B(KL ~pp)=(8. 4 +1.1)X10
and B(KI ~pIJ)=(5. 8
+0.72) X10, which
are
lower
than
the
previous
world average of B =(9.58+, ~}X10
. It is well known
that the intermediate
2y state dominates
the imaginary
part of the amplitude
for this process and calculations
yield B(KL ~2y ~pp) =(6.83+0.28) X 10
. Geng and
where x =232/81.
Experimentally
one must search for an exclusive mode,
typically
B—+K'y,
where
the
current
limit
is
B(B~K'y) &2.4X10
. The ratio of exclusive
to in-
clusive rates contains great theoretical
uncertainty,
mak-
ing
comparisons
of theory
to experiment
difficult.
A
recent
(and
conservative)
estimate
is r(B~K'y)/
I'(b -+sy
)=0.06, which when combined
with the data on
the exclusive branching
fraction yields the inferred bound
B(b ~sy ) &4X 10
. We will see that this level of sensi-
tivity
is beginning
to confront
the
possible
branching
fraction enhancements
due to H* contributions,
and that
any future increase in experimental
sensitivity
will either
further
restrict the parameters
in the charged
Higgs sec-
tor or reveal new physics.
Figure 5 shows B(b ~sy } including
SM and H* con-
tributions

values of m
For comparison,
the SM branching
fraction
and the in-
ferred experimental
upper bound are also depicted
in the
figure.
We have performed
our own fit of the SM results
in terms of m, and
find that the branching
fraction
is
roughly
given by
' 0.53
Ng
have
averaged
these
two recent
measurements
of
B(KL ~pjM
) with the previous
value, and then subtracted
the 2y contribution
to obtain a constraint
on the real part
of the amplitude
of B[ReA (KL ~@AM)] &1.5X10
. If
no
cancellations
occur
between
the
short-
and
long-
distance
contributions
to the real part of this amplitude
then the short-distance
contributions
alone obey this con-
straint.
However
it has been shown
in Ref. 58 that such
cancellations
may in fact occur and thus no restrictions
on the short-distance
contributions
may be obtained
from
this process.
In any case we find that
the above con-
straint of Ref. 57 on the short-distance
contributions
to
EL
pp provides
no additional
constraints
on m
y and
tanp once the bounds
from e have been taken
into ac-
count.
The diagrams
that
may
potentially
contribute
to the
real part of the SM and H* short-distance
amplitude
for
KL ~JLip, are shown
in Fig. 2 (with q =s and a muon line
replacing
the quark
line on the right)
and Fig. 3 (with
q =s, q'=d, f =p, and a Z boson is exchanged).
Note
that for on-shell
muons
in the final state, electromagnetic
current conservation
leads to a null contribution
from the
photon-exchange
term.

tion to the decay width is (in models I and II with m, =0}

This
process
is also
mediated
by
a single
where
A, = V', V.d and D (xg, z; ) is defined by
D(x,z, )=DsM(x, z; )+D~H(x, z; )+DHH(x, z;
)
+cot'PDzH(x,
,z; ),
(2.31)
with
operator
(due to the V —A structure of the Z-boson neu-
trino
coupling)
and
the QCD radiative
corrections
are
again
applied
to this operator.
We employ
the QCD
corrections
calculated
for DsM (which have been found
to
have
a
smaller
effect
than
for
b —vsy )
to
D =DsM+cot PDzH.
The current
experimental
limit
on this
branching
ratio
is B(E+~m+vV)(3.0X10
and the BNL E-787 experiment
expects to reach a sensi-
tivity of B(K+~n+vv) -2X10
'
in the future.
%e incorporate
the results
of our combined
analysis
below
in our calculations
of B(E+~n+vv) (due to the
dependency
of the range of predicted
branching
fractions
on the allowed
values of the appropriate
KM elements)
and thus present our results for this branching
fraction at
the end of Sec. II F.
F. Combined
analysis
Here we combine
the results of the previous
sections
and
determine
the regions
of charged-Higgs-boson
pa-
rameter space which are consistent
with low-energy
data.
In the spirit of Ref. 61, a Monte Carlo analysis
is em-
ployed
in order to probe the freedom
in the KM sector:
10 sets of the four parameters
(3 mixing angles 8, 2 3 and
1 phase 5) present
in the three-generation

in the calculation of these branching
fractions.
X 10
.
The
possible
constraints
from
the
decay
KL ~pp also do not reduce the allowed
parameter
space
once the above restrictions
are satisfied.
We then calculate B (b ~sy ) in models I and II for the
parameters
which
have
survived
all of the
above
con-
straints.
Demanding
consistency
with the inferred
exper-
imental
bound B(busy) (4.0X 10
we find additional
limits on m
+ and tanp in both models.
Further
bounds
are also obtained
by requiring
e'le to lie within
+2cJ of
the published
NA31 data of e'/e=(3. 3+1.1)X 10
The results
from this analysis
are presented
in Fig. 7
which
shows the allowed
regions
in the m
+,tanp plane
for m, =60, 90, 120, and 150 GeV. The solid curve corre-
sponds
to the
combined
restrictions
from Bd-B d and
D Dmixing,
e,
b,Mz-,
and
~e'le~ (5.0X10, the
short-dashed
(dashed-dotted)
curve
depicts
the
con-
straints
from the decay b usy
in model II (I), the long-
dashed
curve represents
the limits
from the NA31 data
on e'/e, and the dotted curve illustrates
the perturbative
bound
of Eq. (1.5); for m, =60 GeV, the
perturbative
bound
is tanP & 0. 1. The excluded
regions
lie to the left
of the curves.
Clearly,
the constraints
from
these pro-
cesses become stronger as the top quark becomes heavier.
It is interesting
to note that the perturbative
bound alone
provides
a rough
estimate
of the combined
restrictions
for m
~ ~ 100 GeV (except for NA31 e'le constraints).
In Fig. 8 we show the predicted
values for the branch-
ing fraction
for the decay E+~m+vv
as a function
of
tanp with the values of m, and m
~ as indicated.
The al-
lowed regions
lie between
the curves.
The results of our
above
analysis
[including
the
constraints
of Eq. (2.35)
only]
are
incorporated
in
our
calculations
for
B(K+~m+vv).
The SM predictions
for this branching
fraction
coincide
with
these
results
at large
tanp
(i.e.,
tanp~3).
We see that
for all values
of m
+ and for
tanp~ 3 the charged-Higgs-boson
contributions
have the
effect of narrowing
and slightly
suppressing
the range of
allowed
branching
fractions compared
to the SM predic-
tions.
For tanp~3
the SM contributions
become
dom-
inant.
III. CONSTRAINTS FROM pp COLLIDER DATA
A. Searches for top and large missing E&
Heavy quarks
can be produced
at the CERN and Fer-
milab pp colliders at masses well beyond
the range acces-
sible
to
present
e
e
machines.
Top-quark
signals
(based on SM semileptonic
decays
r ~bl v with I =e or p)
have been sought'
'
but have not yet been found;
this
places lower
limits
on the mass m, in the SM. But m,
values
below these limits
are possible,
provided
the SM
decays
are
somehow
sufficiently
suppressed.
In
the
present
context
of
two-Higgs-doublet
models,
such
41

~
3433
suppression
can be provided
by competition
with
non-
standard
top decays
via a real or virtual
charged
Higgs
boson,
t ~bH+
(the
eventual
charged
leptons
from
H+~~v, ~~lvv
have
a much
softer
spectrum
than
those
from t~blv
and
few
survive
the
experimental
cuts).
Hence for "SM excluded"
values of m, (i.e., for
m, (77 GeV) the nonobservation
of top signals
may be
used to constrain
the parameters
in the charged
Higgs
sector by requiring
sufticient
competition
from t~bH
modes.
Loosely speaking,
this approximates
to demand-
ing that m~+ & m, —m~ for SM excluded
values of m„
since top decays to real H+ are very competitive
with
virtual
W+ modes,
whereas
decays
via virtual
H+ are
generally
not competitive.
Our analysis
however
is based
on exact calculations
of the
competing
H+
and 8'+
channels'
and
we find
significant
departures
from
the
above approximate
statement of the bound on m
The pp collider
experiments
have
also searched
for
events with large missing transverse
energy (denoted Ez),
since this can be a signal for production
of SUSY parti-
cles or other new physics.
It can, in particular,
also be a
signal for charged-Higgs-boson
production
because of the
undetected
neutrinos
in H
~rv~vvqq
' (or vvvl)
de-
cay. Assuming
that H +—are produced
from top-quark
de-
cays (the only copious mechanism
at hand), upper
limits
on the frequency
of events with large missing
Ez- will im-
ply constraints
on the two-Higgs-doublet
model parame-
ters for any given m, . In this spirit, upper limits on non-
standard
contributions
with large Er from the data of the
UA1 experiment
at CERN have already
been used to
set limits'
on the H* parameters
in model II.
The most stringent
present
limits on top-quark
produc-
tion and on events with large gz come from the CDF ex-
periment
at the Fermilab
Tevatron
collider. '
We use
their results to constrain
two-Higgs-doublet
models.
B. Implications
of CDF data
The CDF Collaboration'
first looked for a top signal
based
on
an
isolated
charged
lepton
plus jets, which
might
arise from pp ~ttX or W~tb events
where
only
one top quark decays semileptonically.
The experimental
acceptance for such events varies with m, and the experi-
mental
upper
limit
on a possible
signal
therefore
also
varies
with
m, . The theoretical
prediction
for a signal
depends
strongly
on m, but also on imprecisely
known
parton
distributions
and QCD parameters;
we conserva-
tively assume
the lowest possible
tt production
cross sec-
tion
in our analysis.
The lower
bound
on m,
is the
point where the experimental
upper limit and theoretical
lower
limit
cross;
currently
this
gives'
m, &77 GeV
(90%%uo C.L.).
Values of m, below 77 GeV are excluded unless the SM
tt signal is suppressed
by 8 (t ~bW*) having a value less
than unity.
For a given sign of lepton, say, l, this signal
arises mainly
from t ~bS'*+~bl+v with t decaying
ei-
ther via 8'*
or via H . We have calculated
that the
experimental
acceptance for the 8"+H
modes is simi-
lar to (and
in fact slightly
exceeds) that for W'+W'
modes.
Hence, the effective bound that can be placed on
8(t~bW*) is
8 (t~bW') ~
experimental
O.-„upper limit
theory
O.-„ lower limit
—:R(m, ) .
(3.1)
We calculate
this branching
fraction
as in Ref. 12, for
both real- and virtual-Higgs-boson
cases, including
small
contributions
such as t ~sS', sH and H ~us, ub. The re-
sult is insensitive
to the precise values of the KM matrix
elements,
since the dominant
channels
have matrix
ele-
ments =1.
The CDF Collaboration
also searched
for an isolated
e+p signal,
such
as might
arise from
tt events
where
both t and t decay semileptonically.
These results can be
used to derive a second, independent
bound similar to Eq.
(3.1). However,
these constraints
are less stringent
than
Eq. (3.2), so we do not use them here.
The CDF experiment
also
scanned
for events
with
large gz and jets, subject to a stringent
set of acceptance
cuts designed
to remove backgrounds
from mismeasured
QCD jets, W+jets, etc. For Er ~60 GeV, with
an in-
tegrated
luminosity
of 4.6 pb
', 34 events were observed;
the expected
background
from
standard
model
sources
(excluding
unknown
top decays) is 38+17 events. '
The
latter
is not precisely
determined
because
it is derived
from
observed
W and Z event
distributions
and
from
heavy-quark
Monte
Carlo
calculations.
We treat
the
background
as having a Gaussian
probability
distribution
with mean 38 and standard
deviation
17 and derive the
bound
a (nonstandard
physics:
Ez. & 60 GeV: CDF cuts)
~4.2 pb
(3.3)
at
90%%uo C.L. (see Appendix
B). Similarly
for Ez ~40
GeV, 184 events
were observed
with expected SM back-
ground
158+35 events
from these numbers
we derive
another bound:
0(nonstandard
physics: Ez) 40 GeV: CDF cuts)
~ 16 pb
(3.4)
at
90%%uo C.L. The two missing-Ez.
bounds
are not com-
pletely
independent
since
the
event
samples
overlap.
Their implied
constraints
on the model parameters
turn
out to be rather
similar;
we therefore
illustrate
only the
gz ~ 60 GeV bound of Eq. (3.3).
To evaluate
the constraints
from gz. bounds,
we calcu-
late
charged-Higgs-boson
production
and
decay
by
Monte Carlo methods
as in Ref. 12. Conservatively,
we
evaluate
only the dominant
pp ~ttX production
by 2~3
This limit is quite conservative;
it ignores
possible
small
contributions
from H ~v.v~l vv decays and the fact that
some top quarks
are produced
from W~tb.
Reading
values of R from the CDF graphs, '
we obtain approxi-
matel-y

(ignoring
electroweak
W~rb
and
g8'~tb channels
that are less important
at the Fermilab
Tevatron
energy) and include top decay via real or virtual
8'and charged Higgs bosons.
For each m, we normalize
our total cross section to the lowest value of the theoreti-
cal range in Ref. 64, and simulate
the full cascade of de-
cays, coalescing
final
partons
into jets within
cones of

r)=lntan(8/2)
is
the pseudorapidity,
0 and P are the polar and azimuthal
angle with respect to the beam axis. %e include standard
measurement
errors on the lepton and jet ET, and evalu-
ate the Er from the overall transverse
energy
imbalance.
Muons
often deposit
only a fraction of their energy
and
thus
generate
apparent
ET', since this
measurement
is
diScult to simulate
accurately,
we conservatively
ignore
events
containing
muons
with pr(p))2 GeV.
Finally,
we apply CDF acceptance
cuts including
jet kinematics,
multiplicity,
and coplanarity,
and vetos on hard electron
or
muon
candidates.
The
resulting
cross
section
for
ET) 60 GeV is then
compared
with
the bound
of Eq.
(3 3).
C. Numerical
results
Figure
9 shows
the
effects of the
constraints
(3.2)
and
(3.3) in
the
tang,
m
+ plane
for
model
I with
m, =50,60,70, 80 GeV. In this figure, the regions
which
lie on the same side of the curves as the cross hatching
are
excluded.
The
left-hand
margin
of this
figure,
tanP=0. 1, is approximately
the boundary
of the pertur-
bative
region
defined
in Eq. (1.5).
The
lower
margin
m +=25 GeV is near the present
experimental
limit.
The top-search
bound,
denoted
by solid curves, excludes
the upper
part of the figure (m
+ ~ m, ) and also the ex-
treme right-hand
side (tanP~10) for rn, &70 GeV. The
missing-ET
constraints,
denoted
by dashed
curves,
ex-
cludes most of the remaining
parameter
space, at least for
ln, & 70 GeV [the remaining
areas, though
not strictly ex-
cluded at the level of Eq. (3.3), are nevertheless
excluded
at 80% confidence
level and therefore
strongly
disfavored
for m, &70 GeV].
Figure 10 shows the corresponding
bounds
in the tanP,
m
y plane for model II. Again, the areas which are on
H
the cross-hatched
side of the curves are excluded.
Here
the left-hand
margin
is approximately
the perturbative
boundary
of Eq. (1.5) as before; the right-hand
margin
tanP=100 is approximately
the other perturbative
bound-
ary, where the AH coupling
proportional
to rnbtanP
be-
comes too large.
The top-search
bound, denoted
by solid
curves,
lies near
m
+ ~ m, —mb for the middle
range of
tanP values,
but deviates
considerably
from this value at
the extremes
(the regions
where top decay via Uirtual H
becomes
competitive).

denoted
by dashed
curves,
excludes
essentially
all the
remaining
area for tanP&
1 with m, & 70 [the allowed
re-
gions on the right of Fig. 10(c) are technically
within
the
limits
but
nevertheless
again
strongly
disfavored].
For
m, =80 this constraint
is ~eaker.
The possibility
of a "light" top quark
with
m, «70
GeV and perturbative
tbH couplings
is thus
essentially
excluded
in
model
I, but
survives
in
model
II for
0. 1&tanP&1.
(It has
also been
shown
that
a Higgs-
triplet representation
does not provide
enough competi-
tion via t~H+6 to invalidate
the CDF top-quark
mass
bounds. )
Because charged-Higgs-boson
production
is dominant-
ly (in our calculation
entirely) from top-quark
production
and decay, the signals
get weaker
and the experitnental
limits
become
less
constraining
as m,
increases.
The
missing-ET
bounds
in Eqs. (3.3) and (3.4) give weak con-
straints
for m, =80 GeV and no constraints
for m, ~90
GeV with our conservative
calculations.
The top-search
bound of Eq. (3.2) is operative
only below the SM experi-
mental limit (i.e., for m, & 77 GeV at present).
Since the top-search
bound
depends
essentially
on the
net branching
fraction
to electrons 8(t~bev)
and the
missing-ET
bound
depends
on the net branching
fraction
to taus B(t~biv),
it is instructive
to compare
these
quantities
for models I-IV. Figure
11 shows 8 (t ~bev)
vs
m
~ for tanP=0. 5, 1.0,2.0.
Note
that
all
models
coincide for tanp= l. The top-quark
search limit essen-
tially
requires 8 &0.029,0.039,0.054 for m, =50,$0,70
GeV, respectively
(values indicated
by cross-hatched
lines
in the figure).
Models II and IV are equally
constrained;
model III is similar to model I but more strongly
restrict-
ed at large tanP.
Figure
12 shows 8(t —oh')
vs m
~ for the same set
of tanP values:
again
all models
coincide
for tanP=l.
The missing-Ez
bound, although
dependent
on other fac-
tors too, approximately
requires 8 &0.25,0.30,0.35,0.50
for m, =50,60,70, 80 GeV, respectively
(values
indicated
by cross-hatched
lines in the figure).
Models II and IV
are equally
constrained;
model III is similar
to model I
but less strongly
bounded
at large tanP.

theories of electroweak

ing, charged

Suppose
N events
have
been seen, with
known
back-
ground 8 (i.e., 8 =mean number of expected background
events).
The probability
that ns of the observed N events
were due to background
has Poisson distribution:

(conservatively)
that any signal

if S «N this will be ap-
proximately
the case}. For given
N, B,S the probability

and the confidence
level with which this value of S can be
excluded is 1 minus this probability.
In our present
work
B is not precisely
known,
but a mean value Bo and stan-
dard
deviation
AB are given.
We therefore
take B to
have a continuous
Gaussian
probability
distribution
with
these parameters.
Since B cannot be negative
we restrict
it to the range 0&B &280 (which
is conservative
and
also ensures
that
the mean
value
remains
at Bo ), with
Gaussian
weight -exp[ —
—,'(8 —80) /(58) ] normalized
to 1 in this range.
We then replace the right-hand
side of
Eq. (B3) by the Gaussian
weighted
mean
and take the
corresponding
confidence level.

number
of events
